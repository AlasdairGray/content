    "description": "The mitochondrial brown fat uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) is a member of the family of mitochondrial anion carrier proteins (MACP). UCPs separate oxidative phosphorylation from ATP synthesis with energy dissipated as heat, also referred to as the mitochondrial proton leak. UCPs facilitate the transfer of anions from the inner to the outer mitochondrial membrane and the return transfer of protons from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane. They also reduce the mitochondrial membrane potential in mammalian cells. UCP1 is expressed only in brown adipose tissue, a specialized tissue which functions to produce heat.",
