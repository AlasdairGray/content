Published and maintained by Sozzani Lab at North Carolina State University.\n\nTo install, run TuxNet-MacStandaloneInstaller.app in the TuxNet-MacStandalone directory. You will be prompted to choose a directory where TuxNet will be installed and to install MATLAB Runtime if it is not already installed",
