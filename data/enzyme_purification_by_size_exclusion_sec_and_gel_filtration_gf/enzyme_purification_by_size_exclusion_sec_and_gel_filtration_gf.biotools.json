    "description": "Based on different characteristics of enzyme molecules, Creative Enzymes has established several methods for enzymes isolation and purification. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) is based on the variation of relative molecular mass of different enzymes. Creative Enzymes has a skilled technical team to achieve efficient separation of enzyme mixtures. Creative Enzymes offers the best enzyme purification by size exclusion and gel filtration relying on the extensive experiences, a large reagent library, and excellent operation facilities.",
