  "sc:description": "Detecting Behavioral Patterns for Diagnosis and Rehabilitation of Visual Neglect.\n\nABSTRACT Visual neglect is a frequent and disabling consequence of right brain damage. Traditional paper- and-pencil tests of neglect have limitations in sensitivity and ecological validity. The Baking Tray Task (BTT), instead, approaches real-life situations, because it requires participants to place 16 physical objects on a board. The number of objects placed on the left and right portions of the board provides a clinical index of visual neglect. Here we present E-TOKEN, a technology-enhanced https: www.overleaf.com project 5dc6d9c64de4e60001116764 version of the BTT. E-TOKEN automatically determines the object locations on the board, and also records the sequence and timing of their placement.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'technology-enhanced', 'Detecting Behavioral Patterns Diagnosis Rehabilitation Visual Neglect', 'E-TOKEN technology-enhanced', 'BTT'",
