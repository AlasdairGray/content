  "sc:description": "Detecting and Isolating Mass Balance Errors in Reaction Based Models in Systems Biology.\n\nModel checker for the Antimony kinetics modeling lanauge.\n\nMany biological models are based on chemical reactions. For example, glycolysis, arguably the most widely exercised metabolic pathway in biology, begins by transforming the reactants glucosue (Glu) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into the products glucose 6-phosphate (GluP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP), or: Glu + ATP -> GluP + ADP. Examples of biological modeling techniques that rely on reactions include flux balance analysis and kinetics models.\n\nSBMLLint is a tool that lints reactions.\n\nToday's biological models typically consist of tens to hundreds of reactions.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'LP'",
