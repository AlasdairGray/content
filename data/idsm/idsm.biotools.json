                "abstract": "\u00a9 2018, The Author(s).Background: Structure search is one of the valuable capabilities of small-molecule databases. Fingerprint-based screening methods are usually employed to enhance the search performance by reducing the number of calls to the verification procedure. In substructure search, fingerprints are designed to capture important structural aspects of the molecule to aid the decision about whether the molecule contains a given substructure. Currently available cartridges typically provide acceptable search performance for processing user queries, but do not scale satisfactorily with dataset size. Results: We present Sachem, a new open-source chemical cartridge that implements two substructure search methods: The first is a performance-oriented reimplementation of substructure indexing based on the OrChem fingerprint, and the second is a novel method that employs newly designed fingerprints stored in inverted indices. We assessed the performance of both methods on small, medium, and large datasets containing 1, 10, and 94 million compounds, respectively. Comparison of Sachem with other freely available cartridges revealed improvements in overall performance, scaling potential and screen-out efficiency. Conclusions: The Sachem cartridge allows efficient substructure searches in databases of all sizes. The sublinear performance scaling of the second method and the ability to efficiently query large amounts of pre-extracted information may together open the door to new applications for substructure searches.",

                "abstract": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2019.Motivation: The existing connections between large databases of chemicals, proteins, metabolites and assays offer valuable resources for research in fields ranging from drug design to metabolomics. Transparent search across multiple databases provides a way to efficiently utilize these resources. To simplify such searches, many databases have adopted semantic technologies that allow interoperable querying of the datasets using SPARQL query language. However, the interoperable interfaces of the chemical databases still lack the functionality of structure-driven chemical search, which is a fundamental method of data discovery in the chemical search space. Results: We present a SPARQL service that augments existing semantic services by making interoperable substructure and similarity searches in small-molecule databases possible. The service thus offers new possibilities for querying interoperable databases, and simplifies writing of heterogeneous queries that include chemical-structure search terms. Availability: The service is freely available and accessible using a standard SPARQL endpoint interface. The service documentation and user-oriented demonstration interfaces that allow quick explorative querying of datasets are available at https://idsm.elixir-czech.cz.",
