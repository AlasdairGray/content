description: "Lucy is a utility that prepares raw DNA sequence fragments for sequence\
  \ assembly, possibly using the TIGR Assembler. The cleanup process includes quality\
  \ assessment, confidence reassurance, vector trimming and vector removal. The primary\
  \ advantage of Lucy over other similar utilities is that it is a fully integrated,\
  \ stand alone program. . Lucy was designed and written at The Institute for Genomic\
  \ Research (TIGR, now the J. Craig Venter Institute), and it has been used here\
  \ for several years to clean sequence data from automated DNA sequencers prior to\
  \ sequence assembly and other downstream uses. The quality trimming portion of lucy\
  \ makes use of phred quality scores, such as those produced by many automated sequencers\
  \ based on the Sanger sequencing method. As such, lucy\u2019s quality trimming may\
  \ not be appropriate for sequence data produced by some of the new \u201Cnext-generation\u201D\
  \ sequencers."
