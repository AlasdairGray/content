It takes cryoID two sequencial steps to get the job done, with two subprograms called get_queries and search_pool respectively. More technical details are given in our Nature Methods paper. If you find cryoID useful, please cite this paper.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Bottom-up structural proteomics', 'malaria-causing'",
