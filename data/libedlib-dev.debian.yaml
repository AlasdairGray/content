  description: library for sequence alignment using edit distance (devel)
  long_description: " A lightweight and super fast C/C++ library for sequence alignment\
    \ using\n edit distance.\n .\n Calculating edit distance of two strings is as\
    \ simple as:\n .\n  edlibAlign(\"hello\", 5, \"world!\", 6,\n             edlibDefaultAlignConfig()).editDistance;\n\
    \ Features\n .\n  * Calculates edit distance (Levehnstein distance).\n  * It can\
    \ find optimal alignment path (instructions how to transform\n    first sequence\
    \ into the second sequence).\n  * It can find just the start and/or end locations\
    \ of alignment path -\n    can be useful when speed is more important than having\
    \ exact\n    alignment path.\n  * Supports multiple alignment methods: global(NW),\
    \ prefix(SHW) and\n    infix(HW), each of them useful for different scenarios.\n\
    \  * You can extend character equality definition, enabling you to e.g.\n    have\
    \ wildcard characters, to have case insensitive alignment or to\n    work with\
    \ degenerate nucleotides.\n  * It can easily handle small or very large sequences,\
    \ even when finding\n    alignment path, while consuming very little memory.\n\
    \  * Super fast thanks to Myers's bit-vector algorithm.\n .\n This package contains\
    \ the static library and the header files.\n"
