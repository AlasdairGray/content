  description: Pacific Biosciences binary alignment/map (BAM) library (headers)
  long_description: " The BAM format is a binary, compressed, record-oriented container\
    \ format\n for raw or aligned sequence reads. The associated SAM format is a text\n\
    \ representation of the same data. The specifications for BAM/SAM are maintained\n\
    \ by the SAM/BAM Format Specification Working Group.\n .\n PacBio-produced BAM\
    \ files are fully compatible with the BAM specification,\n but makes use of the\
    \ extensibility mechanisms of the BAM specification to\n encode PacBio-specific\
    \ information. The pbbam library provides tools to\n work with these files\n .\n\
    \ This package contains the library header files.\n"
