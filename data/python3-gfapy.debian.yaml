  description: flexible and extensible software library for handling sequence graphs
  long_description: " The Graphical Fragment Assembly (GFA) are formats for the representation\
    \ of\n sequence graphs, including assembly, variation and splicing graphs. Two\n\
    \ versions of GFA have been defined (GFA1 and GFA2) and several sequence\n analysis\
    \ programs have been adopting the formats as an interchange format,\n which allow\
    \ the user to easily combine different sequence analysis tools.\n .\n This library\
    \ implements the GFA1 and GFA2 specification. It is possible to\n create a Gfa\
    \ object from a file in the GFA format or from scratch, to\n enumerate the graph\
    \ elements (segments, links, containments, paths and header\n lines), to traverse\
    \ the graph (by traversing all links outgoing from or\n incoming to a segment),\
    \ to search for elements (e.g. which links connect two\n segments) and to manipulate\
    \ the graph (e.g. to eliminate a link or a segment\n or to duplicate a segment\
    \ distributing the read counts evenly on the copies).\n .\n The GFA format can\
    \ be easily extended by users by defining own custom tags\n and record types.\
    \ In Gfapy, it is easy to write extensions modules, which\n allow one to define\
    \ custom record types and datatypes for the parsing and\n validation of custom\
    \ fields. The custom lines can be connected, using\n references, to each other\
    \ and to lines of the standard record types.\n"
