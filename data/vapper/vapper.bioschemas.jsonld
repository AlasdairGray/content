These organisms use antigenic variation to evade the host immune response, for which their genomes contain many hundreds of variable antigen genes. Making sense of this hypervariable repertoire is a major challenge in genome analysis and a bottleneck in vaccine development | the VAPPER code for the first time, please type:",
