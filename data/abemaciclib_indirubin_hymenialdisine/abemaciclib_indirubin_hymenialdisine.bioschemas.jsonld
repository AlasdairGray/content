      "sc:description": "Molecular Dynamics Mechanisms of the Inhibitory Effects of Abemaciclib, Hymenialdisine, and Indirubin on CDK-6.\n\nBACKGROUND:Cyclin-Dependent Kinases-6 (CDK-6) is a serine threonine protein kinase with regular activity in the cell cycle. Some inhibitors, such as abemaciclib, hymenialdisine, and indirubin, cause cell arrest by decreasing its activity. OBJECTIVES:The purpose of this study was to evaluate the Molecular Dynamic (MD) effects of abemaciclib, hymenialdisine, and indirubin on the structure of CDK-6. METHODS:The PDB file of CDK-6 was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (http: www.rcsb.org). After the simulation of CDK-6 in the Gromacs software, 200 stages of molecular docking were run on CDK-6 in the presence of the inhibitors using AutoDock 4.2.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'abemaciclib hymenialdisine indirubin', 'abemaciclib hymenialdisine indirubin inhibitors', 'hymenialdisine indirubin', 'abemaciclib hymenialdisine'",
