  "sc:description": "Holistic characterization of autoantigen repertoires for a better understanding of autoimmune diseases.\n\nAutoimmune diseases are mostly characterized by autoantibodies in the patients' serum or cerebrospinal fluid, representing diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers. For decades, research has focused on single autoantigens or panels of single autoantigens. In this article, we advocate to broaden the focus by addressing the entire autoantigen repertoire in a systemic \"omics-like\" way. This approach aims to capture the enormous biodiversity in the sets of targeted antigens and pave the way toward a more holistic understanding of the concerted character of antibody-related humoral immune responses. Ongoing technological progress permits high-throughput screenings of thousands of autoantigens in parallel, e.g., via protein microarrays, phage display, or immunoprecipitation with mass spectrometry.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
