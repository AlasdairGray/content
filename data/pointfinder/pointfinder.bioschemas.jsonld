      "sc:description": "Improved Resistance Prediction in Mycobacterium tuberculosis by Better Handling of Insertions and Deletions, Premature Stop Codons, and Filtering of Non-informative Sites.\n\nResistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a major obstacle for effective treatment of tuberculosis. Multiple studies have shown promising results for predicting drug resistance in M. tuberculosis based on whole genome sequencing (WGS) data, however, these tools are often limited to this single species. We have previously developed a common platform for resistance prediction in multiple species. This platform detects acquired resistance genes (ResFinder) and species-specific chromosomal mutations (PointFinder) associated with resistance, all based on WGS data. In this study, we present a new version of PointFinder together with an updated M. tuberculosis database. PointFinder now includes predictions based on insertions and deletions, and it explicitly reports frameshift mutations and premature stop codons",
