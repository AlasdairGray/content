    "description": "iPath is a tool developed by IMIM which provides mechanistic hypotheses for drug adverse events. iPath aims at identifying pathways in functional networks that connect drug targets, off-targets, ADME proteins and proteins associated to the toxicity phenotype elicited by a drug. It leverages information from diverse omics datasets, namely protein interaction networks, toxicogenomics data, gene and protein expression data, genotype-phenotype associations and chemical biology information. \niPath uses as input tissue/organ-specific protein interaction networks and a list of genes of interest (seed genes), and after mapping the seeds to the network it applies network optimisation algorithms to identify the subnetwork. It can be used to identify molecular pathways related to drug toxicity.",
