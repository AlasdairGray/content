  "sc:description": "a contact-assisted de novo protein structure prediction using global exploration and loop perturbation sampling algorithm.\n\nMOTIVATION:Regions that connect secondary structure elements in a protein are known as loops, whose slight change will produce dramatic effect on the entire topology. This study investigates whether the accuracy of protein structure prediction can be improved using a loop-specific sampling strategy. RESULTS:A novel de novo protein structure prediction method that combines global exploration and loop perturbation is proposed in this study. In the global exploration phase, the fragment recombination and assembly are used to explore the massive conformational space and generate native-like topology. In the loop perturbation phase, a loop-specific local perturbation model is designed to improve the accuracy of the conformation and is solved by differential evolution algorithm.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE BROKEN!",
