Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.High-throughput data production technologies, particularly 'next-generation' DNA sequencing, have ushered in widespread and disruptive changes to biomedical research. Making sense of the large datasets produced by these technologies requires sophisticated statistical and computational methods, as well as substantial computational power. This has led to an acute crisis in life sciences, as researchers without informatics training attempt to perform computation-dependent analyses. Since 2005, the Galaxy project has worked to address this problem by providing a framework that makes advanced computational tools usable by non experts. Galaxy seeks to make data-intensive research more accessible, transparent and reproducible by providing a Web-based environment in which users can perform computational analyses and have all of the details automatically tracked for later inspection, publication, or reuse. In this report we highlight recently added features enabling biomedical analyses on a large scale.",

The system is available through easy-to-use web interfaces, including the Galaxy workbench for data analysis and workflow execution. Users confident with a command-line interface and programming may also access it through Secure Shell (SSH) and application programming interfaces (APIs). NeLS has been in production since 2015, with training and support provided by the help desk of ELIXIR Norway. Through collaboration with NorSeq, the national consortium for high-throughput sequencing, an integrated service is offered so that sequencing data generated in a research project is provided to the involved researchers through NeLS. Sensitive data, such as individual genomic sequencing data, are handled using the TSD (Services for Sensitive Data) platform provided by Sigma2 and the University of Oslo. NeLS integrates national e-infrastructure storage and computing resources, and is also integrated with the SEEK platform in order to store large data files produced by experiments described in SEEK. In this article, we outline the architecture of NeLS and discuss possible directions for further development.",
