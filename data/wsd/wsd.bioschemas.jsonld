We have developed a method that can be used to automatically develop a WSD test collection using the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus and the manual MeSH indexing of MEDLINE.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/ncbi_resources (NLM.NIH.GOV), bio.tools/genbank (NLM.NIH.GOV).\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'BiLSTM'",
