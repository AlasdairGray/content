  "sc:description": "a computational method for Consequence-Agnostic Pathogenicity Interpretation of Clinical Exome variations.\n\nCAPICE is a computational method for predicting the pathogenicity of SNVs and InDels. It is a gradient boosting tree model trained using a variety of genomic annotations used by CADD score and trained on the clinical significance. CAPICE performs consistently across diverse independent synthetic, and real clinical data sets. It ourperforms the current best method in pathogenicity estimation for variants of different molecular consequences and allele frequency.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/MOLGENIS_Research (GITHUB.COM/molgenis)",
