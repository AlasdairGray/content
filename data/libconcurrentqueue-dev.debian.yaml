  description: industrial-strength lock-free queue for C++
  long_description: " Features\n  * Knock-your-socks-off blazing fast performance.\n\
    \  * Single-header implementation. Just drop it in your project.\n  * Fully thread-safe\
    \ lock-free queue. Use concurrently from any number\n    of threads.\n  * C++11\
    \ implementation -- elements are moved (instead of copied)\n    where possible.\n\
    \  * Templated, obviating the need to deal exclusively with pointers --\n    memory\
    \ is managed for you.\n  * No artificial limitations on element types or maximum\
    \ count.\n    Memory can be allocated once up-front, or dynamically as needed.\n\
    \  * Fully portable (no assembly; all is done through standard C++11\n    primitives).\n\
    \  * Supports super-fast bulk operations.\n  * Includes a low-overhead blocking\
    \ version (BlockingConcurrentQueue).\n  * Exception safe.\n .\n Reasons to use\n\
    \ .\n There are not that many full-fledged lock-free queues for C++. Boost has\n\
    \ one, but it's limited to objects with trivial assignment operators and\n trivial\
    \ destructors, for example. Intel's TBB queue isn't lock-free,\n and requires\
    \ trivial constructors too. There're many academic papers\n that implement lock-free\
    \ queues in C++, but usable source code is hard\n to find, and tests even more\
    \ so.\n .\n This queue not only has less limitations than others (for the most\
    \ part),\n but it's also faster. It's been fairly well-tested, and offers advanced\n\
    \ features like bulk enqueueing/dequeueing (which, with the new design, is\n much\
    \ faster than one element at a time, approaching and even surpassing\n the speed\
    \ of a non-concurrent queue even under heavy contention).\n"
