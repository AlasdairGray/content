description: The PHYLogeny Inference Package is a package of programs for inferring
  phylogenies (evolutionary trees) from sequences. Methods that are available in the
  package include parsimony, distance matrix, and likelihood methods, including bootstrapping
  and consensus trees. Data types that can be handled include molecular sequences,
  gene frequencies, restriction sites, distance matrices, and 0/1 discrete characters.
