  "sc:description": "An interactive genomic graph viewer.\n\nCopyright 2017-2019 by Peter Andrews at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.\n\nG-Graph is a free-software (MIT license) graphical desktop application that allows you to perform efficient exploratory analysis of genomic copy number and other numeric datasets. G-Graph can be installed and runs under the Linux, Mac, and Windows operating systems. G-Graph's features include the ability to easily zoom and scroll the view, alter the visual display properties, display gene annotations, link genes to the UCSC genome browser, and save application views to image and pdf format. G-Graph is also very fast and therefore supports smooth scrolling and zooming of views even for millions of data points",
