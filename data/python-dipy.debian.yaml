  description: Python library for the analysis of diffusion MRI datasets
  long_description: " DIPY is a software project for computational neuroanatomy. It\
    \ focuses\n on diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) analysis and\n tractography\
    \ but also contains implementations of other computational\n imaging methods such\
    \ as denoising and registration that are\n applicable to the greater medical imaging\
    \ and image processing\n communities. Additionally, DIPY is an international project\
    \ which\n brings together scientists across labs and countries to share their\n\
    \ state-of-the-art code and expertise in the same codebase,\n accelerating scientific\
    \ research in medical imaging.\n .\n Here are some of the highlights:\n  - Reconstruction\
    \ algorithms: CSD, DSI, GQI, DTI, DKI, QBI, SHORE\n    and MAPMRI\n  - Fiber tracking\
    \ algorithms: deterministic and probabilistic\n  - Native linear and nonlinear\
    \ registration of images\n  - Fast operations on streamlines (selection, resampling,\
    \ registration)\n  - Tractography segmentation and clustering\n  - Many image\
    \ operations, e.g., reslicing or denoising with NLMEANS\n  - Estimation of distances/correspondences\
    \ between streamlines and\n    connectivity matrices\n  - Interactive visualization\
    \ of streamlines in the space of images\n"
