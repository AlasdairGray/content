      "sc:description": "A Novel Optimization-Based Tool to Automate Infeasible Cycle-Free Gapfilling of Genome-Scale Metabolic Models.\n\nSUMMARY Stoichiometric metabolic modeling, particularly Genome-Scale Models (GSMs), is now an indispensable tool for systems biology. The model reconstruction process typically involves collecting information from public databases; however, incomplete systems knowledge leaves gaps in any reconstruction. Current tools for addressing gaps use databases of biochemical functionalities to address gaps on a per-metabolite basis and can provide multiple solutions, but cannot avoid Thermodynamically Infeasible Cycles (TICs), invariably requiring lengthy manual curation. To address these limitations, this work introduces an optimization-based multi-step method named OptFill which performs TIC-avoiding whole-model gapfilling. We applied OptFill to three fictional prokaryotic models of increasing sizes and to a published GSM of Escherichia coli , i JR904.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
