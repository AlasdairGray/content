    "description": "This protein is encoded by COX16, corresponding to the previously uncharacterized open reading frame YJL003w of the yeast genome. COX16 was identified in studies of COX-deficient mutants previously assigned to complementation group G22 of a collection of yeast pet mutants. To determine its location, Cox16p was tagged with a Myc epitope at the C terminus.",
