    "description": "CD Genomics provides whole-genome SNP genotyping for the overview of the entire genome by using both microarray technologies and high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS), enabling genome-wide discoveries and screening of the SNP loci. Genome-wide association studies with SNP markers are expected to allow identification of genetic variation that underlie complex disorders.",
