    "description": "The genus Shigella belongs to the family Enterobacteriaceae and is one of the leading bacterial causes of diarrhea worldwide. It consists of four species: Shigella dysenteriae, Shigella flexneri, Shigella boydii, and Shigella sonnei. Each of the species, with the exception of S. sonnei, is subdivided by serotype. These four species are differing by the configuration of the O-antigenic polysaccharide within the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of genus Shigella.",
