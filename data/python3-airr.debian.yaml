  description: Data Representation Standard library for antibody and TCR sequences
  long_description: " This package provides a library by the AIRR community to for\
    \ describing,\n reporting, storing, and sharing adaptive immune receptor repertoire\n\
    \ (AIRR) data, such as sequences of antibodies and T cell receptors\n (TCRs).\
    \ Some specific efforts include:\n  * The MiAIRR standard for describing minimal\
    \ information about AIRR\n    datasets, including sample collection and data processing\
    \ information.\n  * Data representations (file format) specifications for storing\
    \ large\n    amounts of annotated AIRR data.\n  * APIs for exposing a common interface\
    \ to repositories/databases\n    containing AIRR data.\n  * A community standard\
    \ for software tools which will allow conforming\n    tools to gain community\
    \ recognition.\n .\n This package installs the library for Python 3.\n"
