  "sc:description": "> LOW CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'QTLs' | Mapping quantitative trait loci using binned genotypes | Precise mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) is critical for assessing genetic effects and identifying candidate genes for quantitative traits. Interval and composite interval mappings have been the methods of choice for several decades, which have provided tools for identifying genomic regions harboring causal genes for quantitative traits. Historically, the concept was developed on the basis of sparse marker maps where genotypes of loci within intervals could not be observed. Currently, genomes of many organisms have been saturated with markers due to the new sequencing technologies. Genotyping by sequencing usually generates hundreds of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which often include the causal polymorphisms",
