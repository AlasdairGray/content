  "sc:description": "Implementation of the Health Equity Impact Assessment (HEIA) tool in a local public health setting.\n\nSETTING:The Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit (SMDHU) is a local public health agency in Ontario, serving the County of Simcoe and District of Muskoka's population of over 540,000 people in a mixed urban-rural environment. SMDHU has had a strategic focus on the determinants of health since 2007. INTERVENTION:The use of the Health Equity Impact Assessment (HEIA) tool was encouraged throughout SMDHU. An online survey was conducted to assess the implementation of mitigation strategies identified through the HEIAs; in particular, the facilitators and barriers challenges, and the impacts at both the program level and the level of priority populations, themselves, were assessed. OUTCOMES:Agency programs reported 40 HEIAs conducted between 2013 and 2017.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'mitigation', 'mitigation strategies'",
