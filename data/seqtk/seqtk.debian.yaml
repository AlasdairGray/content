description: Currently, seqtk supports quality based trimming with the phred algorithm,
  converting fastq to fasta, reverse complementing sequences, extracting or masking
  subsequences in regions given in a BED/name list file, and more. It contains a subsampling
  module to sample exactly n sequences or a fraction of sequences. . Seqtk supports
  both fasta and fastq input files, which can be optionally gzip compressed.
