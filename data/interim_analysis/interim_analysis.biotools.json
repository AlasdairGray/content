    "description": "The reason why interim analysis is widely used is the soaring cost of clinical research and significant trial failures. In clinical trials and other scientific studies, interim analysis is often performed before the completion of the trial, and the intention of this analysis is to determine whether the trial is terminated prematurely or to adjust the sample size.",
