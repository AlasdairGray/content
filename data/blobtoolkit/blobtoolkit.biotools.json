    "description": "BlobToolKit \u2013 Interactive quality assessment of genome assemblies.\n\nBlobToolKit Viewer is a genome-scale dataset visualistion tool developed as part of the blobtoolkit project to allow browser-based identification and filtering of target and non-target data in genome assemblies.\n\nSpecification and validator for BlobToolKit BlobDir format.\n\nRedesigning BlobTools to support interactive data exploration.\n\nSnakeMake pipeline to run BlobTools on public assemblies.\n\nAs noted in section 2.1, a valid BlobDir can be created with only two files, meta.json and identifiers.json. This allows a BlobDir to be generated iteratively, with new fields added as the data become available. For specific uses of a BlobDir, additional files may be required, for example the BlobToolKit Viewer requires at least a gc.json, a length.json and a {TAXRULE}_{RANK}.json file to produce meaningful plots.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/pymzml (GITHUB.COM)",

                "abstract": "\u00a9 2020 Challis et al.Reconstruction of target genomes from sequence data produced by instruments that are agnostic as to the species-of-origin may be confounded by contaminant DNA. Whether introduced during sample processing or through co-extraction alongside the target DNA, if insufficient care is taken during the assembly process, the final assembled genome may be a mixture of data from several species. Such assemblies can confound sequence-based biological inference and, when deposited in public databases, may be included in downstream analyses by users unaware of underlying problems. We present BlobToolKit, a software suite to aid researchers in identifying and isolating non-target data in draft and publicly available genome assemblies. BlobToolKit can be used to process assembly, read and analysis files for fully reproducible interactive exploration in the browser-based Viewer. BlobToolKit can be used during assembly to filter non-target DNA, helping researchers produce assemblies with high biological credibility. We have been running an automated BlobToolKit pipeline on eukaryotic assemblies publicly available in the International Nucleotide Sequence Data Collaboration and are making the results available through a public instance of the Viewer at https://blobtoolkit.genomehubs.org/view. We aim to complete analysis of all publicly available genomes and then maintain currency with the flow of new genomes. We have worked to embed these views into the presentation of genome assemblies at the European Nucleotide Archive, providing an indication of assembly quality alongside the public record with links out to allow full exploration in the Viewer.",
