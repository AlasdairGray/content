This allows a BlobDir to be generated iteratively, with new fields added as the data become available. For specific uses of a BlobDir, additional files may be required, for example the BlobToolKit Viewer requires at least a gc.json, a length.json and a {TAXRULE}_{RANK}.json file to produce meaningful plots.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/pymzml (GITHUB.COM)",
