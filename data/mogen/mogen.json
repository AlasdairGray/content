                "abstract": "Â© The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press. Motivation: The three-dimensional (3D) conformation of chromosomes and genomes play an important role in cellular processes such as gene regulation, DNA replication and genome methylation. Several methods have been developed to reconstruct 3D structures of individual chromosomes from chromosomal conformation capturing data such as Hi-C data. However, few methods can effectively reconstruct the 3D structures of an entire genome due to the difficulty of handling noisy and inconsistent inter-chromosomal contact data. Results: We generalized a 3D chromosome reconstruction method to make it capable of reconstructing 3D models of genomes from both intra- and inter-chromosomal Hi-C contact data and implemented it as a software tool called MOGEN. We validated MOGEN on synthetic datasets of a polymer worm-like chain model and a yeast genome at first, and then applied it to generate an ensemble of 3D structural models of the genome of human B-cells from a Hi-C dataset. These genome models not only were validated by some known structural patterns of the human genome, such as chromosome compartmentalization, chromosome territories, co-localization of small chromosomes in the nucleus center with the exception of chromosome 18, enriched center-toward inter-chromosomal interactions between elongated or telomere regions of chromosomes, but also demonstrated the intrinsically dynamic orientations between chromosomes. Therefore, MOGEN is a useful tool for converting chromosomal contact data into 3D genome models to provide a better view into the spatial organization of genomes.",
