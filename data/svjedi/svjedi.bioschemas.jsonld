  "sc:description": "Genotyping structural variations with long reads.\n\nSVJedi : Genotyping structural variations with long read data.\n\nSVJedi is a structural variation (SV) genotyper for long read data. Based on a representation of the different alleles, it estimates the genotype of each variant in a given individual sample based on allele-specific alignment counts. SVJedi takes as input a variant file (VCF), a reference genome (fasta) and a long read file (fasta/fastq) and outputs the initial variant file with an additional column containing genotyping information (VCF)",
