  description: development library to support DNA string matching and comparative
    genomics
  long_description: " libMems is a freely available software development library to\
    \ support DNA\n string matching and comparative genomics. Among other things,\
    \ libMems\n implements an algorithm to perform approximate multi-MUM and multi-MEM\n\
    \ identification. The algorithm uses spaced seed patterns in conjunction\n with\
    \ a seed-and-extend style hashing method to identify matches. The method\n is\
    \ efficient, requiring a maximum of only 16 bytes per base of the largest\n input\
    \ sequence, and this data can be stored externally (i.e. on disk) to\n further\
    \ reduce memory requirements.\n .\n This is the development package containing\
    \ the statically linked\n library and the header files.\n"
