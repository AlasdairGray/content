Published by Oxford University Press.Small noncoding RNAs (sRNA/sncRNAs) are generated from different genomic loci and play important roles in biological processes, such as cell proliferation and the regulation of gene expression. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has provided an unprecedented opportunity to discover and quantify diverse kinds of sncRNA, such as tRFs (tRNA-derived small RNA fragments), phasiRNAs (phased, secondary, small-interfering RNAs), Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNAs) and plant-specific 24-nt short interfering RNAs (siRNAs). However, currently available web-based tools do not provide approaches to comprehensively analyze all of these diverse sncRNAs. This study presents a novel integrated platform, sRNAtools (https://bioinformatics.caf.ac.cn/sRNAtools), that can be used in conjunction with high-throughput sequencing to identify and functionally annotate sncRNAs, including profiling microRNAss, piRNAs, tRNAs, small nuclear RNAs, small nucleolar RNAs and rRNAs and discovering isomiRs, tRFs, phasiRNAs and plant-specific 24-nt siRNAs for up to 21 model organisms. Different modules, including single case, batch case, group case and target case, are developed to provide users with flexible ways of studying sncRNA. In addition, sRNAtools supports different ways of uploading small RNA sequencing data in a very interactive queue system, while local versions based on the program package/Docker/virtureBox are also available. We believe that sRNAtools will greatly benefit the scientific community as an integrated tool for studying sncRNAs.",
