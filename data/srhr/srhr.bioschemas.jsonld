      "sc:description": "A Package of Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights Interventions-What Does It Mean for Adolescents?.\n\nThis article analyzes the relevance of the comprehensive definition of sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) to adolescents and identifies adolescent-specific implications for the implementation of an essential package of SRHR interventions. The delivery of a comprehensive approach to SRHR targeting adolescents is underpinned by five principles-equity, quality, accountability, multisectorality, and meaningful engagement. All SRHR interventions included in the package are relevant to adolescents, given the diversity of adolescents' SRHR needs and considering their specific attributes, circumstances, and experiences.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
