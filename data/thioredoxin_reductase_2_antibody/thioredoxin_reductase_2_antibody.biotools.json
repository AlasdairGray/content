    "description": "The mammalian thioredoxin reductases (TrxRs) are a family of seleno-cysteine containing pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxido-reductases. All the mammalian TrxRs are homologous to glutathione reductase with respect to primary structure including the conserved redox catalytic site (-Cys-Val-Asn-Val-Gly-Cys-) but distinctively with a C-terminal extension containing a catalytically active penultimate seleno-cysteine (SeCys) residue in the conserved sequence(-Gly-Cys-SeCys-Gly).",
