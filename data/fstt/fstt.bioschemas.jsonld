      "sc:description": "Facial soft tissue thicknesses in craniofacial identification.\n\nFacial soft tissue thicknesses (FSTT) form a key component of craniofacial identification methods, but as for any data, embedded measurement errors are highly pertinent. These in part dictate the effective resolution of the measurements. As herein reviewed, measurement methods are highly varied in FSTT studies and associated measurement errors have generally not been paid much attention. Less than half (44%) of 95 FSTT studies comment on measurement error and not all of these provide specific quantification. Where informative error measurement protocols are employed (5% of studies), the mean error magnitudes range from 3% to 45% rTEM and are typically in the order of 10-20%.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'FSTT measurement', 'TDValidator', 'Facial soft tissue thicknesses craniofacial identification', 'rTEM'",
