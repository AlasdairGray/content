    "description": "The protein encoded by this gene is a lymphocyte-specific member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily. It interacts with calcium-modulator and cyclophilin ligand (CAML). The protein induces activation of the transcription factors NFAT, AP1, and NF-kappa-B and plays a crucial role in humoral immunity by interacting with a TNF ligand. This gene is located within the Smith-Magenis syndrome region on chromosome 17.",
