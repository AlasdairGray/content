    "description": "Angiostatin is a naturally occurring protein found in several animal species, including humans. It has anti-angiogenic properties originally isolated from the urine of tumor-bearing mice (i.e., it blocks the growth of new blood vessels), and it is currently undergoing clinical trials for its use in anticancer therapy. Angiostatin is a single-chain, proteolytic fragment of glu-plasminogen which has a molecular weight of about 38,000 and possesses anti-angiogenic activity both in vitro and in vivo.",
