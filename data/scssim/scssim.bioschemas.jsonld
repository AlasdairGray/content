  "sc:description": "an integrated tool for simulating single-cell genome sequencing data.\n\na bioinformatics tool for simulating single-cell genome sequencing data.\n\nSCSsim is a tool designed for emulating single-cell genome sequencing data. It consists of three modules: 1) “simuVars” module aims to generate single cell genome from a given reference sequence by inserting user-defined genomic variations into genomic loci; 2) “learnProfile” component is developed to infer sequencing platform dependent profiles from real data; 3) “genReads” utility is provided to mimic single-cell genome amplification and read generation procedures based on the results of “simuVars” and “learnProfile”. More details about the software can be found from here.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'IMPLEMENTATION:SCSsim'",
