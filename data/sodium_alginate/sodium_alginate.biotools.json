    "description": "Sodium alginate is a neutral salt in which the carboxyl groups of alginate are bonded with a sodium ion. Alginic acid is not soluble in water but sodium alginate is soluble in both cold and hot water to produce a smooth viscous solution.When calcium ions are added to a sodium alginate solution, calcium ions react instantly with alginate to form a gel.",
