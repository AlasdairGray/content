    "description": "Best in tertiary structure prediction (as ‘Zhang-Server’) in the community-wide blind benchmarks CASP7 and CASP8. It uses mainly profile-profile comparison to identify templates and alignments for deriving distance constraints. Its power lies in how it combines the distance constraints from up to the 50 best-ranked templates. It performs some knowledge-based free modelling in regions without any template-based information.",

                "abstract": "© 2015 The Author(s). The I-TASSER server (http://zhanglab.ccmb.med. umich.edu/I-TASSER) is an online resource for automated protein structure prediction and structurebased function annotation. In I-TASSER, structural templates are first recognized from the PDB using multiple threading alignment approaches. Full-length structure models are then constructed by iterative fragment assembly simulations. The functional insights are finally derived by matching the predicted structure models with known proteins in the function databases. Although the server has been widely used for various biological and biomedical investigations, numerous comments and suggestions have been reported from the user community. In this article, we summarize recent developments on the ITASSER server, which were designed to address the requirements from the user community and to increase the accuracy of modeling predictions. Focuses have been made on the introduction of new methods for atomic-level structure refinement, local structure quality estimation and biological function annotations. We expect that these newdevelopments will improve the quality of the I-TASSER server and further facilitate its use by the community for highresolution structure and function prediction.",
