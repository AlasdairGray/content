    "description": "Brucellosis is a zoonotic bacterial disease caused by several species in the genus Brucella. Reproductive losses are the most common syndrome in animals, while humans may suffer from a debilitating nonspecific illness or localized involvement of various organs. Cattle are the usual hosts for Brucella abortus. This organism also causes brucellosis in bison, water buffalo, camels and elk, and occasionally affects other species. Most people become infected by direct contact with infected animals or their tissues, or by ingesting contaminated dairy products.",
