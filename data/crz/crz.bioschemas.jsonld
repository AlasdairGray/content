      "sc:description": "Open source geoprocessing tools and meteorological satellite data for crop risk zones monitoring in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nIn Sub-Saharan Africa analysis tools and models based on meteorological satellites data have been developed within different national and international cooperation initiatives, with the aim of allowing a better monitoring of the cropping season. In most cases, the software was a stand-alone application and the upgrading, in terms of analysis functions, database and hardware maintenance, was difficult for the National Meteorological Services (NMSs) in charge of agro-hydro-meteorological monitoring. The web-based solution proposed in this work intends to improve and ensure the sustainability of applications to support national Early Warning Systems (EWSs) for food security.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Niger', 'meteorological', 'NMSs', 'RFE'",
