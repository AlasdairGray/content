  "sc:description": "Trans-NanoSim characterizes and simulates nanopore RNA-seq data.\n\nNanopore sequence read simulator.\n\nNanoSim is a fast and scalable read simulator that captures the technology-specific features of ONT data, and allows for adjustments upon improvement of nanopore sequencing technology.\n\nThe second version of NanoSim (v2.0.0) uses minimap2 as default aligner to align long genomic ONT reads to reference genome. It leads to much faster alignment step and reduces the overall runtime of NanoSim. We also utilize HTSeq, a python package, to read SAM alignment files efficiently.\n\nThe latest version of NanoSim (v2.5.0) is able to simulate ONT transcriptome reads (cDNA directRNA) as well as genomic reads.\n\nHafezqorani, Saber, Chen Yang, Ka Ming Nip, Rene L.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/nanosim (GITHUB.COM/bcgsc/NanoSim)",
