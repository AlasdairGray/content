    "description": "Astrovirus has a non-segmented, single stranded, positive sense RNA genome within a non-enveloped icosahedral capsid. It was first discovered in 1975 using electron microscopes (EM) following an outbreak of diarrhea in humans. Subsequently, similar SRVs were identified from several mammalian (classified as genus Mammoastrovirus) and avian species (classified as genus Avastrovirus).",
