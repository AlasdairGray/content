      "sc:description": "scRNA-seq-based computational tool to control cell subpopulation phenotypes for cellular rejuvenation strategies.\n\nSUMMARY:Single-cell RNA-sequencing is increasingly employed to characterize disease or ageing cell subpopulation phenotypes. Despite exponential increase in data generation, systematic identification of key regulatory factors for controlling cellular phenotype to enable cell rejuvenation in disease or ageing remains a challenge. Here, we present SigHotSpotter, a computational tool to predict hotspots of signaling pathways responsible for the stable maintenance of cell subpopulation phenotypes, by integrating signaling and transcriptional networks. Targeted perturbation of these signaling hotspots can enable precise control of cell subpopulation phenotypes.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/BSA4Yeast (LCSB.UNI.LU), bio.tools/MINERVA_Platform (LCSB.UNI.LU)",
