description: FastQC aims to provide a simple way to do some quality control checks
  on raw sequence data coming from high throughput sequencing pipelines. It provides
  a modular set of analyses which you can use to give a quick impression of whether
  your data has any problems of which you should be aware before doing any further
  analysis. . The main functions of FastQC are * Import of data from BAM, SAM or FastQ
  files (any variant) * Providing a quick overview to tell you in which areas there
  may be problems * Summary graphs and tables to quickly assess your data * Export
  of results to an HTML based permanent report * Offline operation to allow automated
  generation of reports without running the interactive application
