  "sc:description": "Risk-based surveillance for meat-borne parasites.\n\nThere is a plethora of meat-borne hazards - including parasites - for which there may be a need for surveillance. However, veterinary services worldwide need to decide how to use their scarce resources and prioritise among the perceived hazards. Moreover, to remain competitive, food business operators - irrespective of whether they are farmers or abattoir operators - are preoccupied with maintaining a profit and minimizing costs. Still, customers and trade partners expect that meat products placed on the market are safe to consume and should not bear any risks of causing disease. Risk-based surveillance systems may offer a solution to this challenge by applying risk analysis principles; first to set priorities, and secondly to allocate resources effectively and efficiently.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'risk-based surveillance meat-borne', 'risk-based surveillance meat-borne parasites'",
