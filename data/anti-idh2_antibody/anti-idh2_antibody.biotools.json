    "description": "Isocitrate dehydrogenase [NADP], mitochondrial (IDH2) is a 452 amino acid enyzme belonging to the isocitrate and isopropylmalate dehydrogenases family and contains two nucleotide binding regions. IDH2 is involved in the reduction of NADP+ to NADPH and maintains mitochondrial glutathione levels. Studies suggest that IDH2 plays a role in intermediary metabolism and energy production. IDH2 also tightly associates with the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.",
