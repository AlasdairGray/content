  "sc:description": "Activation of Hypoxia-Inducible Factor Signaling Modulates the RNA Protein Interactome in Caenorhabditis elegans.\n\nThe cellular response to hypoxia is crucial to organismal survival, and hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) are the key mediators of this response. HIF-signaling is central to many human diseases and mediates longevity in the nematode. Despite the rapidly increasing knowledge on RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), little is known about their contribution to hypoxia-induced cellular adaptation. We used RNA interactome capture (RIC) in wild-type Caenorhabditis elegans and vhl-1 loss-of-function mutants to fill this gap. This approach identifies more than 1,300 nematode RBPs, 270 of which can be considered novel RBPs. Interestingly, loss of vhl-1 modulates the RBPome. This difference is not primarily explained by protein abundance suggesting differential RNA-binding.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE BROKEN!",
