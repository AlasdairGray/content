      "sc:description": "data dependent-independent acquisition proteomics.\n\nABSTRACT Data dependent acquisition (DDA) and data independent acquisition (DIA) are traditionally separate experimental paradigms in bottom-up proteomics. In this work, we developed a strategy combining the two experimental methods into a single LC-MS MS run. We call the novel strategy, data dependent-independent acquisition proteomics, or DDIA for short. Peptides identified by conventional and robust DDA identification workflow provide useful information for interrogation of DIA scans. Deep learning based LC-MS MS property prediction tools, developed previously can be used repeatedly to produce spectral libraries facilitating DIA scan extraction. A complete DDIA data processing pipeline, including modules for iRT vs RT calibration curve generation, DIA extraction classifier training, FDR control has been developed.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'xmlns:xlink', 'xlink:href802231v1_ufig1'",
