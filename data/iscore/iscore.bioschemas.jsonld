  "sc:description": "an MPI supported software for ranking protein-protein docking models based on a random walk graph kernel and support vector machines.\n\nSupport Vector Machine and Random walk Graph Kernel for Protein Interface Scoring.\n\nWelcome to iScore’s documentation! — iScore documentation.\n\nSupport Vector Machine on Graph kernel for protein-protein conformation ranking.\n\nInstall iScore using pip install iScore.\n\nMinimal information to install the module.\n\niScore offers simple solutions to classify protein-protein interfaces using a support vector machine approach on graph kernels. The simplest way to use iScore is through dedicated binaries that hide the complexity of the approach and allows access to the code with simple command line interfaces. The two binaries are iscore.train and iscore.predict that respectively train a model using a trainging set and use this model to predict the near-native character of unkown conformations.\n\nFree document hosting provided by Read the Docs",
