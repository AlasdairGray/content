      "sc:description": "the power of conservation and allele frequency for variant pathogenic prediction.\n\nABSTRACT Background Prediction of pathogenic variants is one of the biggest challenges for researchers and clinicians in the time of next-generation sequencing technologies. Stratification of individuals based on truly pathogenic variants might lead to improved, personalized treatments. Results We present Frequency Conservation Score (FCS) and Frequency Conservation Score for Mitochondrial DNA (FCSMt) two methods for the detection of pathogenic single nucleotide variants in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, respectively.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Frequency Conservation Score', 'FCSMt'",
