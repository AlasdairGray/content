Additionally, in vitro models such as the culture of permanent human lens epithelium-derived cell lines (LECs) have also been utilized to understand the molecular biology of lens cells. However, these resources remain uncharacterized, specifically regarding their global gene expression and suitability to model lens cell biology. Therefore, we sought to molecularly characterize gene expression in the human LEC, SRA01 04, which is commonly used in lens studies. We first performed short tandem repeat (STR) analysis and validated SRA01 04 LEC for its human origin, as recommended by the eye research community",
