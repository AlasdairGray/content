  "sc:description": "Complete hybrid genome assembly of clinical multidrug-resistant Bacteroides fragilis isolates enables comprehensive identification of antimicrobial-resistance genes and plasmids.\n\nquality filtering tool for long reads.\n\nFiltlong is a tool for filtering long reads by quality. It can take a set of long reads and produce a smaller, better subset. It uses both read length (longer is better) and read identity (higher is better) when choosing which reads pass the filter.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Unicycler' (bio.tools/unicycler), 'Canu-corrected ONT', 'AMR', 'fragilis'",
