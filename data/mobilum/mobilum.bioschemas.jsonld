  "sc:description": "new mobile app to engage visuospatial processing for the reduction of intrusive visual memories.\n\nIntrusive memories are a key symptom of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a prevalent condition causing considerable personal suffering, and entailing large direct and indirect societal costs. While effective treatment options for PTSD exist, on a global scale they are not readily available to many patients in need. In the last years, several studies have shown that the computer game Tetris can reduce the frequency of intrusive memories in healthy subjects (after a trauma analogue), in populations at high risk of developing PTSD, as well as in patients already suffering from PTSD. The presumed mechanism behind this effect is that both Tetris and intrusions require-and therefore compete for-limited visuospatial working memory resources.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
