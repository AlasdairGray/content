  description: Development headers for custom compression for CRAM and others
  long_description: " This library implements the custom CRAM codecs used for \"EXTERNAL\"\
    \ block\n types. These consist of two variants of the rANS codec (8-bit and 16-bit\n\
    \ renormalisation, with run-length encoding and bit-packing also supported\n in\
    \ the latter), a dynamic arithmetic coder, and custom codecs for name/ID\n compression\
    \ and quality score compression derived from fqzcomp.\n .\n They come with small\
    \ command line test tools to act as both compression\n exploration programs and\
    \ as part of the test harness.\n .\n This package contains the development headers\n"
