    "description": "d-StructMAn is a new improved implementation of our earlier tool StructMAn, shipped in a convenient and easily installable container form and extended to annotation of short in-frame indels and alterations arising as a consequence of alternative splicing events. d-StructMAn produces a wide range of structural features by combining information from experimentally resolved structures of many related proteins, which is a unique feature of the StructMAn family tools. Additionally to information from experimentally resolved protein structures, d-StructMAn can also harness all protein structure models stored in the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database.",
