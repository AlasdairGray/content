description: proftmb predicts transmembrane beta-barrel (TMB) proteins in Gram-negative
  bacteria. . For each query protein, proftmb provides both a Z-value indicating that
  the protein actually contains a membrane barrel, and a four-state per-residue labeling
  of upward- and downward-facing strands, periplasmic hairpins and extracellular loops.
