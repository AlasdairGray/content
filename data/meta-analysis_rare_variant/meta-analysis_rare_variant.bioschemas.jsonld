      "sc:description": "An adaptive test for meta-analysis of rare variant association studies.\n\nSingle genome-wide studies may be underpowered to detect trait-associated rare variants with moderate or weak effect sizes. As a viable alternative, meta-analysis is widely used to increase power by combining different studies. The power of meta-analysis critically depends on the underlying association patterns and heterogeneity levels, which are unknown and vary from locus to locus. However, existing methods mainly focus on one or only a few combinations of the association pattern and heterogeneity level, thus may lose power in many situations. To address this issue, we propose a general and unified framework by combining a class of tests including and beyond some existing ones, leading to high power across a wide range of scenarios.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'aSPUmeta'",
