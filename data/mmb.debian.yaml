  description: model the structure and dynamics of macromolecules
  long_description: " MacroMoleculeBuilder, previously known as RNABuilder, can be\
    \ used for morphing,\n homology modeling, folding (e.g. using base pairing contacts),\
    \ redesigning\n complexes, fitting to low-resolution density maps, predicting\
    \ local\n rearrangements upon mutation, and many other applications.\n"
