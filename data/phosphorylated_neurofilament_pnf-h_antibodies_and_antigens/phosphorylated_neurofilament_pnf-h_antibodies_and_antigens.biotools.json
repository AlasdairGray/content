    "description": "Neurofilament (NF) constitutes the main structural elements of neuronal axons and dendrites. Neurofilaments from the central nervous system are heteropolymers composed of four subunits - neurofilament heavy(NFH), medium(NFM), light polypeptides(NFL) and internexin (or peripherin, in the peripheral nervous system). NF subunits are present in neurons, neuronal processes, peripheral nerves, and sympathetic ganglion cells.",
