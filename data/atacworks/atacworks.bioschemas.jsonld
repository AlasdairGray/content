  "sc:description": "A deep convolutional neural network toolkit for epigenomics.\n\nSDK for deep learning based processing of Atac-seq data.\n\nAtacWorks is a deep learning toolkit for track denoising and peak calling from low-coverage or low-quality ATAC-Seq data.\n\nAtacWorks trains a deep neural network to learn a mapping between noisy (low coverage/low quality) ATAC-Seq data and matching clean (high coverage/high quality) ATAC-Seq data from the same cell type. Once this mapping is learned, the trained model can be applied to improve other noisy ATAC-Seq datasets",
