  "sc:description": "A Tool for the Characterization of Animal Microbiomes from Metagenomic Data.\n\nAbstract The complete characterization of a microbiome is critical in elucidating the complex ecology of the microbial composition within healthy and diseased animals. Many microbiome studies characterize only the bacterial component, for which there are several well-developed sequencing methods, bioinformatics tools and databases available. The lack of comprehensive bioinformatics workflows and databases have limited efforts to characterize the other components existing in a microbiome. BiomeSeq is a tool for the analysis of the complete animal microbiome using metagenomic sequencing data. With its comprehensive workflow, customizable parameters and microbial databases, BiomeSeq can rapidly quantify the viral, fungal, bacteriophage and bacterial components of a sample and produce informative tables for analysis.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
