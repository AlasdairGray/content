  "sc:description": "Development and validation of DNA metabarcoding COI primers for aquatic invertebrates using the R package \"PrimerMiner\".\n\n1) DNA metabarcoding is a powerful tool to assess biodiversity by amplifying and sequencing a standardized gene marker region. However, typically used barcoding genes, such as the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) region for animals, are highly variable. Thus, different taxa in communities under study are often not amplified equally well and some might even remain undetected due to primer bias.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'primers', 'metabarcoding'",
