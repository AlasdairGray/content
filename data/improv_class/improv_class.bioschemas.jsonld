      "sc:description": "WELL-BEING AND COMMUNITY BELONGING FOR OLDER AFRICAN AMERICANS IN LOW-INCOME HOUSING.\n\nAbstractArts-based interventions can enhance the quality of life of older adults, but community-dwelling older adults may have reduced access to such interventions. The purpose of this study was to examine whether a creative arts program can improve the overall health and well-being of older adults in low-income housing. A university social work department and community agency collaborated in establishing a professionally run theater group of older adults in two low-income housing buildings in an urban area. All residents were encouraged to participate. The study consisted of three twelve-week acting and improvisation courses, focusing on either staged reading of monologues and dialogues, co-writing a script, or staged reading of a complete play.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE BROKEN!.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/Diffeomorphic (IC.OUP.COM)",
