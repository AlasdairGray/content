  description: development libraries and header files for libzerg
  long_description: " Zerg is a C library for lexing - lexically scanning - the output\
    \ of NCBI\n BLAST programs.\n .\n Based on a\n GNU Flex-generated lexical scanner,\
    \ it runs extremely fast, being especially\n useful for processing large volumes\
    \ of data. Benchmark tests show that Zerg\n is over two orders of magnitude faster\
    \ than some widely used BLAST parsers.\n .\n If you need a parser and not only\
    \ a lexer, check out librostlab-blast.\n .\n This package contains the header\
    \ files and documentation\n needed to develop applications with libzerg.\n"
