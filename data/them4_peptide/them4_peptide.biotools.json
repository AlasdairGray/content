    "description": "Protein kinase B (PKB) is a major downstream target of receptor tyrosine kinases that signal via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Upon cell stimulation, PKB is translocated to the plasma membrane, where it is phosphorylated in the C-terminal regulatory domain. The protein encoded by this gene negatively regulates PKB activity by inhibiting phosphorylation.",
