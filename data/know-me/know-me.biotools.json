This paper presents the development and evaluation of a design toolkit to facilitate the work of designers and healthcare professionals in personalising dementia care. This toolkit, named \u201cKnow-me\u201d, was grounded in the findings of Ergonomics in Aging, Co-design, and Data-enabled Design, derived from literature review and from the field during a four-year doctorate project. \u201cKnow-me\u201d was designed to be easily accessible, flexible, and engaging, providing concrete and hands-on guidance for designers and healthcare professionals to use in designing for personalised dementia care. A proof-of-concept evaluation of the \u201cKnow-me\u201d toolkit was conducted via student projects on design for dementia care. During this process, we found that \u201cKnow-me\u201d could be adapted flexibly so that the care team could use some of the tools by themselves. A feature-by-feature comparison of the \u201cKnow-me\u201d toolkit with similar state-of-the-art toolkits was conducted, and based upon this, the strengths and weaknesses of the \u201cKnow-me\u201d toolkit are discussed. This preliminary study indicates that the \u201cKnow-me\u201d toolkit is a helpful addition to the current pool of toolkits on designing for dementia care.",
