  "sc:description": "An Open-Source Determinant-Driven Suite of Programs.\n\n<div> <div> <div> <p> < p><div> <div> <div> <p>Quantum Package is an open-source programming environment for quantum chemistry specially designed for wave function methods. Its main goal is the development of determinant-driven selected configuration interaction (sCI) methods and multi-reference second-order perturbation theory (PT2). The determinant-driven framework allows the programmer to include any arbitrary set of determinants in the reference space, hence providing greater method- ological freedoms. The sCI method implemented in Quantum Package is based on the CIPSI (Configuration Interaction using a Perturbative Selection made Iteratively) algorithm which complements the variational sCI energy with a PT2 correction.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Quantum', 'div div div div div', 'div div div div', 'div div div'",
