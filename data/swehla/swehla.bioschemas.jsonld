      "sc:description": "the high confidence HLA typing bio-resource drawn from 1000 Swedish genomes.\n\nThere is a need to accurately call human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes from existing short-read sequencing data, however there is no single solution that matches the gold standard of Sanger sequenced lab typing. Here we aimed to combine results from available software programs, minimizing the biases of applied algorithm and HLA reference. The result is a robust HLA population resource for the published 1000 Swedish genomes, and a framework for future HLA interrogation. HLA 2nd-field alleles were called using four imputation and inference methods for the classical eight genes (class I: HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C; class II: HLA-DPA1, HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRB1). A high confidence population set (SweHLA) was determined using an n-1 concordance rule for class I (four software) and class II (three software) alleles.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
