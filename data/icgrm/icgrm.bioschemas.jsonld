      "sc:description": "integrative construction of genomic relationship matrix combining multiple genomic regions for big dataset.\n\nBACKGROUND:Genomic prediction is an advanced method for estimating genetic values, which has been widely accepted for genetic evaluation in animal and disease-risk prediction in human. It estimates genetic values with genome-wide distributed SNPs instead of pedigree. The key step of it is to construct genomic relationship matrix (GRM) via genome-wide SNPs; however, usually the calculation of GRM needs huge computer memory especially when the SNP number and sample size are big, so that sometimes it will become computationally prohibitive even for super computer clusters. We herein developed an integrative algorithm to compute GRM.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'calculating GRM', 'calculation GRM'",
