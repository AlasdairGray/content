    "description": "Dehydroepiandrosterone is the most abundant adrenal androgen in humans and exists predominately in a sulfated form (DHEAS). DHEA sulfotransferase, known as SULT2A1, converts the androgen precursor DHEA to its inactive sulfate ester, DHEAS. The unconjugated molecules can be converted directly to androgens. Dehydroepiandrosterone is converted to DHEAS in the adrenal glands and liver. DHEA in adults is present at plasma concentrations 100 to 500 times higher than those of testosterone. DHEA can be metabolized to androgens and/or estrogens in the prostate. Hepatic metabolites include 16\u03b1-hydroxy-DHEA, 7\u03b1-hydroxy-DHEA, and 7-oxo-DHEA. 7beta-OH-DHEA is a metabolite. The major metabolite produced in humans is a mono-hydroxylated DHEA species. Synthesis of a 7\u03b1-hydroxy-DHEA and 5-androstene-3\u03b2, 17\u03b2-diol occurs in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, cerebellum and striatum.",
