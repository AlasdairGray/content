    "description": "dsDNA (double stranded deoxyribonucleic acid) is the genetic material of all cells and many viruses and is a polymer of nucleotides. The monomer consists of phosphorylated 2-deoxyribose N-glycosidically linked to one of four bases, adenine, cytosine, guanine or thymine. These are linked together by 3',5'-phosphodiester bridges. In the Watson-Crick double-helix model, two complementary strands are wound in a right-handed helix and held together by hydrogen bonds between complementary base pairs.",
