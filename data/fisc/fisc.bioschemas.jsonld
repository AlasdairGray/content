      "sc:description": "Building Capacity and Expanding Curricula Across an Academic Health Center.\n\nBackground :The ability of health professions faculty to design, teach, evaluate, and improve relevant curricula is vital for teaching improvement science (IS) skills to trainees. Objective :We launched a Foundational Improvement Science Curriculum (FISC) to build faculty competence in IS teaching and scholarship, and to develop, expand, and standardize IS curricula across one institution. Methods :FISC consisted of 9 full or half-day sessions over 10 months in 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 academic years. Each session required pre-work, including readings, Institute for Healthcare Improvement Open School modules, and personal improvement projects. Sessions included brief didactics, group activities, planning, and feedback on curriculum development.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Faculty Development Improvement Science', 'GME', 'curricula', 'UME'",
