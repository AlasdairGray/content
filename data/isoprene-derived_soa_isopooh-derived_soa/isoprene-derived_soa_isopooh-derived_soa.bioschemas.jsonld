  "sc:description": "Understanding the Early Biological Effects of Isoprene-Derived Particulate Matter Enhanced by Anthropogenic Pollutants.\n\nINTRODUCTION:Airborne fine particulate matter (PM2.5; particulate matter ≤ 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter) plays a key role in air quality, climate, and public health. Globally, the largest mass fraction of PM2.5 is organic, dominated by secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formed from atmospheric oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Isoprene from vegetation is the most abundant nonmethane VOC emitted into Earth's atmosphere.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'precursors isoprene-derived SOA ISOPOOH-derived SOA', 'isoprene-derived SOA MAE- ISOPOOH-derived SOA', 'isoprene-derived SOA ISOPOOH-derived SOA alters', 'isoprene-derived SOA'",
