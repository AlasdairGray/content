  "sc:description": "Using n-Level Structural Equation Models for Causal Modeling in Fully Nested, Partially Nested, and Cross-Classified Randomized Controlled Trials.\n\nComplex data structures are ubiquitous in psychological research, especially in educational settings. In the context of randomized controlled trials, students are nested in classrooms but may be cross-classified by other units, such as small groups. Furthermore, in many cases only some students may be nested within a unit while other students may not. Such instances of partial nesting requires a more flexible framework for estimating treatment effects so that the model coefficients are correctly estimated.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE BROKEN!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'SEM' (bio.tools/sem), 'xxm', 'n-level', 'cross-classified'",
