    "description": "Etiology Porcine parvovirus (PPV) is a disease of swine characterized by embryonic and fetal infection and death when susceptible sows and gilts are exposed to the virus during the first 70 days of gestation. The infection typically causes no observable clinical signs in the infected female, and its major impact on animal health relates to the agent's ability to interfere with live births. Porcine parvovirus is one of the major infectious causes of embryonic and fetal death.",
