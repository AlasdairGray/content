      "sc:description": "An online database for exploring over 2,000 Arabidopsis small RNA libraries.\n\nSmall RNAs (sRNAs) play a wide range of important roles in plants, from maintaining genome stability and enhancing disease resistance to regulating developmental processes. Over the past decade, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have allowed us to explore the sRNA populations with unprecedented depth and accuracy. The community has accumulated a tremendous amount of sRNA sequencing (sRNA-seq) data from various genotypes, tissues, and treatments. However, it has become increasingly challenging to access these \"big data\" and extract useful information, particularly for researchers lacking sophisticated bioinformatics tools and expensive computational resources.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE BROKEN!",
