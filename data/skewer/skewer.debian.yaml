description: skewer implements the bit-masked k-difference matching algorithm dedicated
  to the task of adapter trimming and it is specially designed for processing next-generation
  sequencing (NGS) paired-end sequences. . Features . * Detection and removal of adapter
  sequences * Insertion and deletion allowed in pattern matching * Targeted at Single
  End, Paired End (PE), and Long Mate Pair (LMP) reads * Demultiplexing of barcoded
  sequencing runs * Multi-threading support * Trimming based on phred quality scores
  * IUPAC characters for barcodes and adapters * Compressed input and output support
