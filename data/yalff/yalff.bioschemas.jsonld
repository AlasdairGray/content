  "sc:description": "Better quality score compression through sequence-based quality smoothing.\n\nYALFF (Yet Another Lossy FASTQ Filter) is a smoother for FASTQ files which uses an FM-Index to store the k-mer database. The compressed index greatly reduces the amount of memory required compared to other tools such as QUARTZ. This is because the dictionary of k-mers can be linearized into contigs",
