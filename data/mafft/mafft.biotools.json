Published by Oxford University Press.Summary: We report an update for the MAFFT multiple sequence alignment program to enable parallel calculation of large numbers of sequences. The G-INS-1 option of MAFFT was recently reported to have higher accuracy than other methods for large data, but this method has been impractical for most large-scale analyses, due to the requirement of large computational resources. We introduce a scalable variant, G-large-INS-1, which has equivalent accuracy to G-INS-1 and is applicable to 50 000 or more sequences.",

As a result of recent advances in sequencing technologies, huge numbers of biological sequences are available and the need for MSAs with large numbers of sequences is increasing. To extract biologically relevant information from such data, sophistication of algorithms is necessary but not sufficient. Intuitive and interactive tools for experimental biologists to semiautomatically handle large data are becoming important. We are working on development of MAFFT toward these two directions. Here, we explain (i) the Web interface for recently developed options for large data and (ii) interactive usage to refine sequence data sets and MSAs.",
