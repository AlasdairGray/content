  "sc:description": "a High-Throughput Method to Profile Different Types of Protein-DNA Interactions.\n\nABSTRACT DNA-protein interactions play pivotal roles in many cellular activities, such as replication, development, and DNA repair. Here we report a DNB-based on-chip Motif Finding (DocMF) system that utilizes next-generation-sequencing chips to profile protein binding or cleaving activity toward several hundred millions or billions of DNA sequences. Using DocMF, we successfully identified a variety of endonuclease recognition sites and the protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) sequences of different CRISPR effector proteins. Compared with the widely used PAM depletion assay, our DocMF platform can simultaneously screen both 5’ and 3’ sequences adjacent to the protospacer to identify PAMs with high coverage using the same DNB library pool.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
