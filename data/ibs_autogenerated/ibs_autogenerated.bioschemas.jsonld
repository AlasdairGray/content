Edge and Graham Coop.\n\nREADME for gedmatch figures & emails.\n\nThe files marked GEDmatch_*_Redacted.pdf are printouts of the display of the GEDmatch 1-to-1 match genome browser. The colour key did not print out so a screenshot is saved out in GEDmatch_ColourKey_Screenshot.png.\n\nEach file is a match between a target and bait kit. The first 3 files are T1 matches with B1, B2, and Bmis. The next 3 files (3-6) the matches for T2 and so on.\n\nThe kit numbers assigned by GEDmatch have been redacted out, to prevent reuse.\n\n||| NAME EQUAL TO (PUB. DIFFERENT) bio.tools/ibs",
