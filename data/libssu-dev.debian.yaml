  description: de facto repository for high-performance phylogenetic diversity calculations
    (dev)
  long_description: " The de facto repository for high-performance phylogenetic diversity\n\
    \ calculations. The methods in this repository are based on an\n implementation\
    \ of the Strided State UniFrac algorithm which is faster,\n and uses less memory\
    \ than Fast UniFrac. Strided State UniFrac supports\n Unweighted UniFrac, Weighted\
    \ UniFrac, Generalized UniFrac, Variance\n Adjusted UniFrac and meta UniFrac.\
    \ This repository also includes Stacked\n Faith (manuscript in preparation), a\
    \ method for calculating Faith's PD\n that is faster and uses less memory than\
    \ the Fast UniFrac-based\n reference implementation.\n .\n This package contains\
    \ the static library and header files."
