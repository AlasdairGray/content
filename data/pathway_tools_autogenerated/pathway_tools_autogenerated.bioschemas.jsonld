The software has been licensed by more than 10,000 groups and powers a number of websites for biological databases. Pathway Tools integrates a broad set of capabilities that span genome informatics, pathway informatics, regulatory informatics, and omics data analysis. The software supports multiple use cases in bioinformatics and systems biology:.\n\n||| NAME EQUAL TO (PUB.
