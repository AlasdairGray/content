    "description": "CD Genomics has been providing the accurate and affordable human genome resequencing service for a couple of years. CD Genomics introduces previously hidden PacBio SMRT technology that has great application potential in human genome resequencing. The long single-molecule reads reveal structural variants and produce direct variant phasing information across haplotype blocks and methylation. This is very helpful to broaden the utility of precision medicine efforts to improve human health, and greatly promote the development of human single-gene diseases, complex diseases and tumor genomes.",
