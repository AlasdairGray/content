  description: C++ library for parsing and manipulating VCF files (development)
  long_description: " The Variant Call Format (VCF) is a flat-file, tab-delimited\
    \ textual format\n intended to concisely describe reference-indexed variations\
    \ between\n individuals. VCF provides a common interchange format for the description\
    \ of\n variation in individuals and populations of samples, and has become the\
    \ defacto\n standard reporting format for a wide array of genomic variant detectors.\n\
    \ .\n vcflib provides methods to manipulate and interpret sequence variation as\
    \ it\n can be described by VCF. It is both:\n .\n  * an API for parsing and operating\
    \ on records of genomic variation as it can\n    be described by the VCF format,\n\
    \  * and a collection of command-line utilities for executing complex\n    manipulations\
    \ on VCF files.\n .\n This package contains the static library and the header\
    \ files.\n"
