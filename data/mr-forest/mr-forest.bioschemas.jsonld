      "sc:description": "A Deep Decision Framework for False Positive Reduction in Pulmonary Nodule Detection.\n\nWith the development of deep learning methods such as convolutional neural network (CNN), the accuracy of automated pulmonary nodule detection has been greatly improved. However, the high computational and storage costs of the large-scale network have been a potential concern for the future widespread clinical application. In this paper, an alternative Multi-ringed (MR)-Forest framework, against the resource-consuming neural networks (NN)-based architectures, has been proposed for false positive reduction in pulmonary nodule detection, which consists of three steps. First, a novel multi-ringed scanning method is used to extract the order ring facets (ORFs) from the surface voxels of the volumetric nodule models; Second, Mesh-LBP and mapping deformation are employed to estimate the texture and shape features.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'LUNA16'",
