  "sc:description": "Optical Map-Based Genome Scaffolding.\n\nDue to the current limitations of sequencing technologies, de novo genome assembly is typically carried out in two stages, namely contig (sequence) assembly and scaffolding. While scaffolding is computationally easier than sequence assembly, the scaffolding problem can be challenging due to the high repetitive content of eukaryotic genomes, possible mis-joins in assembled contigs, and inaccuracies in the linkage information. Genome scaffolding tools either use paired-end mate-pair linked Hi-C reads or genome-wide maps (optical, physical, or genetic) as linkage information. Optical maps (in particular Bionano Genomics maps) have been extensively used in many recent large-scale genome assembly projects (e.g., goat, apple, barley, maize, quinoa, sea bass, among others).\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
