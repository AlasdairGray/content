    "description": "Like all Viscofan BioEngineering collagen products, our soluble collagen is derived from bovine skin and provides in-vivo-like conditions to positively influence adherence, growth and differentiation of your cells. The nature-like matrix to promote authentic cell performance is well suited for     \u2022 tissue engineering e.g. of  skin, osteogenic, endothelial, hepatocytic and other tissues     \u2022 analysis of cell migration, e.g. at metastasis, wound healing or developmentSoluble collagen can be used as a thin coating for 2D cell culture in any cell culture dish. For use in 3D cell culture, collagen hydrogels can be generated using standard protocols. The high collagen concentration of 5 mg/ml provides freedom to select the optimal gel density for your cells.In addition, this flexible matrix may be mixed with factors like other ECM components, antibiotics or growth factors, e.g. for directed cell manipulation.",
