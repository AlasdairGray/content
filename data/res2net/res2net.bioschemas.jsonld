  "sc:description": "A New Multi-scale Backbone Architecture | A New Multi-scale Backbone Architecture – 程明明教授主页 | Figure 1. We propose a novel building block for CNNs, namely Res2Net, by constructing hierarchical residual-like connections within one single residual block. The Res2Net represents multi-scale features at a granular level and increases the range of receptive fields for each network layer. The proposed Res2Net block can be plugged into the state-of-the-art backbone CNN models, e.g., ResNet, ResNeXt, BigLittleNet, and DLA. We evaluate the Res2Net block on all these models and demonstrate consistent performance gains over baseline models",
