      "sc:description": "Deep annotation of untargeted LC-MS metabolomics data with Binner.\n\nWhen a metabolite is analyzed by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), it is usually detected as multiple ion species due to the presence of isotopologues, adducts, and in-source fragments that cannot be readily identified. Binner is a Java application that takes a numerical feature table obtained from any preprocessing software (e.g. XCMS, MZmine) as input and outputs a file with clusters of closely eluting, highly correlated metabolite features that are most related, along with their pairwise correlations, mass differences, and putative annotations.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/metscape_3 (MED.UMICH.EDU).\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'IMPLEMENTATION:Binner'",
