    "description": "Sm (Smith) is a small nuclear ribonucleoprotein composed of several polypeptides of differing molecular weights. They include B/B\u2019, D, E, F, and G, which range in size from 9 kD to 29.5 kD. The principle reactivity has been shown to reside in the B/B\u2019, and D polypeptides. Sm is one of the autoantigens commonly referred to as extractable nuclear antigens (ENA).",
