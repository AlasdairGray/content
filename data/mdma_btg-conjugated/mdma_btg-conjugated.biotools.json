    "description": "MDMA (3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine) \u2013 colloquially known as ecstasy, often abbreviated \"E\" or \"X\" \u2013 is an entactogenic drug of the phenethylamine and amphetamine class of drugs. MDMA can induce euphoria, a sense of intimacy with others, and diminished anxiety. Many studies, particularly in the fields of psychology and cognitive therapy, have suggested that MDMA has therapeutic benefits and facilitates therapy sessions in certain individuals, a practice for which it had formally been used in the past.",
