      "sc:description": "In silico design and molecular basis for the selectivity of Olinone toward the first over the second bromodomain of BRD4.\n\nBromodomains (BrDs), a conserved structural module in chromatin-associated proteins, are well known for recognizing Îµ-N-acetyl lysine residues on histones. One of the most relevant BrDs is BRD4, a tandem BrD containing protein (BrD1 and BrD2) that plays a critical role in numerous diseases including cancer. Growing evidence shows that the two BrDs of BRD4 have different biological functions; hence selective ligands that can be used to study their functions are of great interest. Here, as a follow-up of our previous work, we first provide a detailed characterization study of the in silico rational design of Olinone as part of a series of five tetrahydropyrido indole-based compounds as BRD4 BrD1 inhibitors.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'BrD1 Olinone BrD2 Olinone', 'BRD4 BrD1 Olinone BrD2', 'Olinone BrD2 Olinone', 'BrD1 Olinone BrD2'",
