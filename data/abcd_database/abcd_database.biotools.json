This concerted effort also includes the Geneva Antibody Facility (for discovery and production of antibodies) and the scientific journal Antibody Reports (publishing technical articles on antibody characterization)",

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.The ABCD (for AntiBodies Chemically Defined) database is a repository of sequenced antibodies, integrating curated information about the antibody and its antigen with cross-links to standardized databases of chemical and protein entities. It is freely available to the academic community, accessible through the ExPASy server (https://web.expasy.org/abcd/). The ABCD database aims at helping to improve reproducibility in academic research by providing a unique, unambiguous identifier associated to each antibody sequence. It also allows to determine rapidly if a sequenced antibody is available for a given antigen.",
