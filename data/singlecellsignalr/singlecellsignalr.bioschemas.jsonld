  "sc:description": "Inference of intercellular networks from single-cell transcriptomics.\n\nABSTRACT Single-cell transcriptomics offers unprecedented opportunities to infer the ligand-receptor interactions underlying cellular networks. We introduce a new, curated ligand-receptor database and a novel regularized score to perform such inferences. For the first time, we try to assess the confidence in predicted ligand-receptor interactions and show that our regularized score outperforms other scoring schemes while controlling false positives. SingleCellSignalR is implemented as an open-access R package accessible to entry-level users and available from https: github.com SCA-IRCM. Analysis results come in a variety of tabular and graphical formats. For instance, we provide a unique network view integrating all the intercellular interactions, and a function relating receptors to expressed intracellular pathways.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'SCA-IRCM'",
