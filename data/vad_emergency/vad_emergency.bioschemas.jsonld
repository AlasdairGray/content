  "sc:description": "A Quality Improvement Project of a Ventricular Assist Device Program.\n\nBACKGROUND:As of December 31, 2016, in the United States, 22 866 patients received left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) (J Heart Lung Transplant. 2017;36(10):1080-1086). First responders are generally unfamiliar with LVAD equipment functionality (J Heart Lung Transplant. 2018;37(4):S275). When a patient has an emergency either clinically or with a controller alarm or failure, speaking with ventricle assist device (VAD)-trained personnel is imperative to the prevention of adverse events. Starting February 2017, an LVAD program totaling 181 patients at a large teaching hospital changed their afterhours process to reduce wait time between patient call and talking to VAD-trained personnel to increase patient safety and patient satisfaction.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'VAD'",
