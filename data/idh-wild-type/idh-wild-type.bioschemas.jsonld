  "sc:description": "An independently validated nomogram for isocitrate dehydrogenase-wild-type glioblastoma patient survival.\n\nBackground:In 2016, the World Health Organization reclassified the definition of glioblastoma (GBM), dividing these tumors into isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wild-type and IDH-mutant GBM, where the vast majority of GBMs are IDH-wild-type. Nomograms are useful tools for individualized estimation of survival. This study aimed to develop and independently validate a nomogram for IDH-wild-type patients with newly diagnosed GBM.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'nomogram' (bio.tools/nomogram), 'Nomogram IDH Wildtype GBM H Gittleman', 'OBTS', 'nomogram IDH-wild-type'",
