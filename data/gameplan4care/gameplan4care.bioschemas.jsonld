      "sc:description": "AN ONLINE TRANSLATION OF REACH II REFINED THROUGH EARLY STAKEHOLDER USABILITY TESTING.\n\nAbstractDespite a number of evidences on the implementation of multicomponent education and support programs to improve the lives of dementia caregivers, there is still a need to adapt these interventions to various implementation settings and preferences of a new generation of caregivers. In this study, we present the development and usability testing of a dementia caregiver support program, GamePlan4Care (GP4C), an online translation of the Resources for Enhancing Alzheimerâ€™s Caregiver Health II (REACH II) intervention. The goal of the GP4C is to create an online family caregiver support system that would facilitate delivery of an evidence-based skills-training and support for dementia caregivers with the potential of both scalability and sustainability.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'GP4C', 'dementia caregivers', 'caregivers', 'caregiver'",
