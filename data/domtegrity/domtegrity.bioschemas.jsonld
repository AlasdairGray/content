  "sc:description": "ensuring web page integrity against malicious browser extensions.\n\nIn this paper, we address an unsolved problem in the real world: how to ensure the integrity of the web content in a browser in the presence of malicious browser extensions. The problem of exposing confidential user credentials to malicious extensions has been widely understood, which has prompted major banks to deploy two-factor authentication. However, the importance of the \"integrity\" of the web content has received little attention. We implement two attacks on real-world online banking websites and show that ignoring the \"integrity\" of the web content can fundamentally defeat two-factor solutions. To address this problem, we propose a cryptographic protocol called DOMtegrity to ensure the end-to-end integrity of the DOM structure of a web page from delivering at a web server to the rendering of the page in the user's browser.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
