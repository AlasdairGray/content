      "sc:description": "a resource for chemical disease semantic extraction in Chinese.\n\nBACKGROUND:To robustly identify synergistic combinations of drugs, high-throughput screenings are desirable. It will be of great help to automatically identify the relations in the published papers with machine learning based tools. To support the chemical disease semantic relation extraction especially for chronic diseases, a chronic disease specific corpus for combination therapy discovery in Chinese (RCorp) is manually annotated. METHODS:In this study, we extracted abstracts from a Chinese medical literature server and followed the annotation framework of the BioCreative CDR corpus, with the guidelines modified to make the combination therapy related relations available. An annotation tool was incorporated to the standard annotation process.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
