    "description": "The Immunoglobulin Intraclonal Diversification Analysis tool (IgIDivA) offers the opportunity for an in-depth analysis of high-throughput sequencing data, with the scope of studying the intraclona diversification process through the identification of the somatic hypermutations that take place within the IGV gene region, the detailed characterization of their connections, the establishment of the mutational pathways and the calculation of metrics that allow the objective determination of the level of ID in a sample, together with statistical analysis for the comparison of different features of the ID level for different groups of samples.",
