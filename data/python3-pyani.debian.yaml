  description: Python3 module for average nucleotide identity analyses
  long_description: " Pyani is a Python3 module and script that provides support for\n\
    \ calculating average nucleotide identity (ANI) and related measures for\n whole\
    \ genome comparisons, and rendering relevant graphical summary\n output. Where\
    \ available, it takes advantage of multicore systems, and\n can integrate with\
    \ SGE/OGE-type job schedulers for the sequence\n comparisons.\n"
