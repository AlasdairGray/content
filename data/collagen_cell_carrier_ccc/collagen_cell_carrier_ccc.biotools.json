    "description": "The Collagen Cell Carrier\u00ae membrane (CCC) is a mobile cell carrier developed for applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Exceptional native collagen fibers, isolated in their complex form from bovine skin represent a natural environment for adherent cells. The special feature: with their preserved strength the fibers build an ultrapure collagen membrane that is self-supportive and enables transfer and further processing of intact cell and tissue cultures on the natural matrix.",
