  "sc:description": "a database of the Regulation of the Hippo Pathway in Cancer Genome.\n\nHippo signaling pathway is a highly conserved pathway, which is consisted of a group of kinases. Dysregulation of Hippo signaling pathway is involved in the initiation and progression of cancer, such as breast cancer, lung cancer and so on. RHPCG serves as a valuable resource for understanding the roles of Hippo signaling pathway in carcinogenesis. The features of RHPCG contain: (i) the landscape of Hippo gene alterations at multiple omics level; (ii) quick search Hippo regulatory motifs by mRNA, lncRNA, circRNA or miRNA; and (iii) all the Hippo related motifs can be visualized as network and be downloaded freely",
