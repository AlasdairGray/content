      "sc:description": "Assessment of the DRT System Based on an Optimal Routing Strategy.\n\nDemand responsive transport (DRT) is operated according to flexible routes, dispatch intervals, and dynamic demand, is attracting a lot of attention. The biggest characteristic of DRT service is that the vehicle routes and schedules are operated optimally based on real-time travel requests of using passengers without fixed operating schedules. Today, the smart-city era has arrived, particularly because of progress in the wireless communications technology and technology related to location information service and real-time passenger demands and requests, and services that change the vehicles&rsquo; operating schedules in real-time according to dynamic demand have attracted more attention.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE BROKEN!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'DRT'",
