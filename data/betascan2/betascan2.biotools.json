    "description": "BetaScan2 is a statistics suite. BetaScan2 can calculate \u03b2std on a predefined window of interest, instead of requiring the use of a sliding window across the genome. This locus-based calculation is made possible by standardization allowing comparison of scores across different window sizes, and enables the use of \u03b2 on species for which only a small fraction of the genome is available.",

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution.Long-term balancing selection results in a build-up of alleles at similar frequencies and a deficit of substitutions when compared with an outgroup at a locus. The previously published \u03b2(1) statistics detect balancing selection using only polymorphism data. We now propose the \u03b2(2) statistic which detects balancing selection using both polymorphism and substitution data. In addition, we derive the variance of all \u03b2 statistics, allowing for their standardization and thereby reducing the influence of parameters which can confound other selection tests. The standardized \u03b2 statistics outperform existing summary statistics in simulations, indicating \u03b2 is a well-powered and widely applicable approach for detecting balancing selection. We apply the \u03b2(2) statistic to 1000 Genomes data and report two missense mutations with high \u03b2 scores in the ACSBG2 gene. An implementation of all \u03b2 statistics and their standardization are available in the BetaScan2 software package at https://github.com/ksiewert/BetaScan.",
