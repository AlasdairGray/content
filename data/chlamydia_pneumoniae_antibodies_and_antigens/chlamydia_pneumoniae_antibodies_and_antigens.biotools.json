    "description": "Chlamydia pneumoniae is an obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen that infects the respiratory tract. The majority of individuals are exposed to C. pneumoniae throughout their lifetimes with an antibody prevalence of 50% by age 20 and 80% by 60-70 years old. Although C. pneumoniae infection is predominantly asymptomatic or mild, it can result in the development of acute upper and lower respiratory illness including bronchitis, pharyngitis, sinusitis, and pneumonia.",
