  "sc:description": "a highly personalised and measurement-based care model to manage youth mental health.\n\nMood and psychotic syndromes most often emerge during adolescence and young adulthood, a period characterised by major physical and social change. Consequently, the effects of adolescent-onset mood and psychotic syndromes can have long term consequences. A key clinical challenge for youth mental health is to develop and test new systems that align with current evidence for comorbid presentations and underlying neurobiology, and are useful for predicting outcomes and guiding decisions regarding the provision of appropriate and effective care.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'adolescent-onset mood psychotic syndromes', 'PERSONALISED MEASUREMENT-BASED CARE YOUTH', 'MEASUREMENT-BASED CARE YOUTH MENTAL', 'adolescent-onset mood psychotic'",
