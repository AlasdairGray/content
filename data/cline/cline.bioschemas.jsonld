  "sc:description": "a web-tool for the comparison of biological dendrogram structures.\n\nThis project was generated with Angular CLI version 6.0.7.\n\nCLINE (Comparison of bioLogIcal deNdrogram structurEs), is a web-tool specifically designed for the visual comparison of dendrograms, with an emphasis on the display of matching clusters that, even when not isomorphic, can be perceived as having the same biological meaning.\n\nRun ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\n\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive:pipe:service:class:guard:interface:enum:module.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/targetmine (MIZUGUCHILAB.ORG)",
