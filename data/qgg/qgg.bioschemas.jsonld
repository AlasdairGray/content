  "sc:description": "an R package for large-scale quantitative genetic analyses.\n\nStatistical tools for Quantitative Genetic Analyses.\n\nAn R package for Quantitative Genetic and Genomic analyses.\n\nProvides an infrastructure for efficient processing of large-scale genetic and phenotypic data including core functions for: 1) fitting linear mixed models, 2) constructing marker-based genomic relationship matrices, 3) estimating genetic parameters (heritability and correlation), 4) performing genomic prediction and genetic risk profiling, and 5) single or multi-marker association analyses. Rohde et al. (2019) <doi:10.1101/503631>.\n\nThe qgg package was developed based on the hypothesis that certain regions on the genome, so-called genomic features, may be enriched for causal variants affecting the trait. Several genomic feature classes can be formed based on previous studies and different sources of information such as genes, chromosomes or biological pathways",
