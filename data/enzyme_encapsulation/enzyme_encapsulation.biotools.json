    "description": "Creative Enzymes provides multiple enzyme modification technologies to customers. Among these, encapsulation of enzyme inside of a host semi-permeable membrane or entrapment in a network matrix such as hydro-gels and other polymeric materials, is of particular interest. In addition, the fabrication process is easily transferrable to other manufacturing sites and does not need sophisticated equipment.",
