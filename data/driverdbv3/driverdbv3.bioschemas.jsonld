This database also uses published bioinformatics algorithms to identify driver genes and present them with different molecular features; there are three functions, ‘Cancer‘ , ‘Gene’ , and ‘Customized-Analysis’ , to help researchers visualize the relationships between cancers and driver genes.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/mirin (YM.EDU.TW)",
