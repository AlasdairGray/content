The RMD files should be ran in the following order:.\n\nThe order of eQTL_target_genes,hotspot_analysis, phenotype_analysis, and bayesian_network_analysis does not matter. Due to the file size, the mRNA expression data resides at PhenoGen.org. The data can be found on the \"Available Data Downloads\" page under the Publications tab and going to the Processed Data section designated for, \"Predictive Modeling of miRNA-mediated Predisposition to Alcohol-related Phenotypes in Mouse.\" The file is titled, \"mRNA_expression_data_full.csv.zip.\" Please use this data in place of the data titled, \"Adjusted_rma.summary.txt.\".\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'miRNA', 'miRNA eQTL'",
