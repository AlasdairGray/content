  "sc:description": "Improved draft of the Mojave Desert tortoise genome, Gopherus agassizii, version 1.1.\n\nExogenous sequence contamination presents a challenge in first-draft genomes because it can lead to non-contiguous, chimeric assembled sequences. This can mislead downstream analyses reliant on synteny, such as linkage-based analyses. Recently, the Mojave Desert Tortoise ( Gopherus agassizii ) draft genome was published as a resource to advance conservation efforts for the threatened species and discover more about chelonian biology and evolution. Here, we illustrate steps taken to improve the desert tortoise draft genome by removing contaminating sequences actions that are typically carried out after the initial release of a draft genome assembly.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE BROKEN!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Vecscreen', 'G agassizii reference update', 'Mojave Desert Tortoise Gopherus agassizii', 'Tortoise Gopherus agassizii'",
