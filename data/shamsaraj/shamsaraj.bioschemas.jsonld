      "sc:description": "A Random Forest Model to Predict the Activity of a Large Set of Soluble Epoxide Hydrolase Inhibitors Solely Based on a Set of Simple Fragmental Descriptors.\n\nBACKGROUND:The Soluble Epoxide Hydrolase (sEH) is a ubiquitously expressed enzyme in various tissues. The inhibition of the sEH has shown promising results to treat hypertension, alleviate pain and inflammation. OBJECTIVE:In this study, the power of machine learning has been employed to develop a predictive QSAR model for a large set of sEH inhibitors. METHODS:In this study, the random forest method was employed to make a valid model for the prediction of sEH inhibition. Besides, two new methods (Treeinterpreter python package and LIME, Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) have been exploited to explain and interpret the model.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/pymzml (GITHUB.COM).\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Treeinterpreter', 'pharm-sbg', 'sEH', 'sEH inhibitors'",
