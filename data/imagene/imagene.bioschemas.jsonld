  "sc:description": "a convolutional neural network to quantify natural selection from genomic data.\n\nImaGene implements a supervised machine learning algorithm to predict natural selection and estimate selection coefficients from population genomic data. Specifically, it uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) which takes as input haplotypes for a population and locus of interest. It outputs confusion matrices as well as point estimates of the selection coefficient along with its posterior distribution and various metrics of confidence",
