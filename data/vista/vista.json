                "abstract": "Motivation: The power of multi-sequence comparison for biological discovery is well established. The need for new capabilities to visualize and compare cross-species alignment data is intensified by the growing number of genomic sequence datasets being generated for an ever-increasing number of organisms. To be efficient these visualization algorithms must support the ability to accommodate consistently a wide range of evolutionary distances in a comparison framework based upon phylogenetic relationships. Results: We have developed Phylo-VISTA, an interactive tool for analyzing multiple alignments by visualizing a similarity measure for multiple DNA sequences. The complexity of visual presentation is effectively organized using a framework based upon interspecies phylogenetic relationships. The phylogenetic organization supports rapid, user-guided interspecies comparison. To aid in navigation through large sequence datasets, Phylo-VISTA leverages concepts from VISTA that provide a user with the ability to select and view data at varying resolutions. The combination of multiresolution data visualization and analysis, combined with the phylogenetic framework for interspecies comparison, produces a highly flexible and powerful tool for visual data analysis of multiple sequence alignments. © Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.",

                "title": "Glocal alignment: Finding rearrangements during alignment", 
                "abstract": "Motivation: To compare entire genomes from different species, biologists increasingly need alignment methods that are efficient enough to handle long sequences, and accurate enough to correctly align the conserved biological features between distant species. The two main classes of pain/vise alignments are global alignment, where one string is transformed into the other, and local alignment, where all locations of similarity between the two strings are returned. Global alignments are less prone to demonstrating false homology as each letter of one sequence is constrained to being aligned to only one letter of the other. Local alignments, on the other hand, can cope with rearrangements between non-syntenic, orthologous sequences by identifying similar regions in sequences; this, however, comes at the expense of a higher false positive rate due to the inability of local aligners to take into account overall conservation maps. Results: In this paper we introduce the notion of glocal alignment, a combination of global and local methods, where one creates a map that transforms one sequence into the other while allowing for rearrangement events. We present Shuffle-LAGAN, a glocal alignment algorithm that is based on the CHAOS local alignment algorithm and the LAGAN global aligner, and is able to align long genomic sequences. To test Shuffle-LAGAN we split the mouse genome into BAC-sized pieces, and aligned these pieces to the human genome. We demonstrate that Shuffle-LAGAN compares favorably in terms of sensitivity and specificity with standard local and global aligners. From the alignments we conclude that about 9% of human/mouse homology may be attributed to small rearrangements, 63% of which are duplications. Availability: Our systems, supplemental information, and the alignment of the human and mouse genomes using Shuffle-LAGAN are available at http://lagan.stanford.edu/glocal. © Oxford University Press 2003; all rights reserved.",
