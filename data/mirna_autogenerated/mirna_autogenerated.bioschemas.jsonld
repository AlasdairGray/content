Milone, \"Complexity measures of the mature for improving pre-miRNAs prediction\".\n\nWelcome to the miRNA-mRNA expression atlas: a knowledge base for studying the expression of miRNAs and their target genes in colorectal cancer.\n\nWe performed an integrative analysis of miRNA-target gene interactions (MTI) on high-throughput molecular profiling of 295 CRC samples obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Our study results in 26,963 correlated MTIs, with focus on the negatively strong correlated MTIs. Our analysis provides a catalogue of MTIs that can serve as a starting point in testing more targeted hypotheses and dealing with CRC functional experiments",
