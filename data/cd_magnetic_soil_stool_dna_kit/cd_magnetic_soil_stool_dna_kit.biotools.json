    "description": "CD Magnetic Soil/Stool DNA Kit is specially designed for genomic DNA isolation from stool samples, all soil samples and other difficult environmental samples containing a high humic acid content, such as compost, sediment, and manure. Based on magnetic-particle technology and specific buffer solution, DNA binds to the silica surface of the magnetic particles free from proteins and other contaminants. The purified DNA can be used directly for molecular biological experiments such as restriction analysis, PCR analysis and NGS.",
