Peptide combination generator (PepCoGen), a web server for generating all the possible combinations of peptides by varying the amino acids having similar physiochemical properties at a particular position.

                "abstract": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 American Chemical Society.Peptides are used as reagents both for basic research and diagnostic purposes. Therefore, there is a need for novel methods for the design of peptide molecules with a particular specific physiochemical profile. The properties of the peptides are governed by the nature of amino acids constituting the peptide. There is a lack of a web server or tools which could predict all the possible combinations of the peptides generated because of the combinations of amino acids based on the physiochemical properties. We have developed a peptide combination generator (PepCoGen), a web server for generating all the possible combinations of peptides by varying the amino acids having similar physiochemical properties at a particular position. It also predicts other properties of the peptides including molecular weight, charge, solubility, hydrophobic plot, and isoelectric point, and random three-dimensional models for each generated combination.",
