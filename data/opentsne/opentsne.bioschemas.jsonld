  "sc:description": "a modular Python library for t-SNE dimensionality reduction and embedding | Extensible, parallel implementations of t-SNE | openTSNE is a modular Python implementation of t-Distributed Stochasitc Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), a popular dimensionality-reduction algorithm for visualizing high-dimensional data sets. openTSNE incorporates the latest improvements to the t-SNE algorithm, including the ability to add new data points to existing embeddings, massive speed improvements, enabling t-SNE to scale to millions of data points and various tricks to improve global alignment of the resulting visualizations",
