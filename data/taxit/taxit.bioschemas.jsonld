  "sc:description": "An iterative and automated computational pipeline for untargeted strain-level identification using MS/MS spectra from pathogenic samples.\n\nAbstract Untargeted accurate strain-level classification of a priori unidentified organisms using tandem mass spectrometry is a challenging task. Reference databases often lack taxonomic depth, limiting peptide assignments to the species level. However, the extension with detailed strain information increases runtime and decreases statistical power. In addition, larger databases contain a higher number of similar proteomes. We present TaxIt, an iterative workflow to address the increasing search space required for MS MS-based strain-level classification of samples with unknown taxonomic origin.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'rki_bioinformatics', 'strain-level'",
