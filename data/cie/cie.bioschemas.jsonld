  "sc:description": "a platform for directional gene set enrichment analysis and inference of active transcriptional regulators.\n\nCausal Inference and Directional Enrichment Methods on Biological Networks.\n\nLaunching Causal Inference Engine...\n\nCIE is a platform for inference of active transcriptional regulators of differential gene expression. CIE provides a user-friendly web-app and an R-package to run inference queries on casual regulatory netowrks. Several regulatory networks are provided in the platform, including a TF-gene intraction network constructed from ChIP-seq and tissue specific gene expression data, a netowrk based on STRING-DB, and curated TF-gene interaction networks such as TRRUST and TRED. The R-package provides functionality for custom networks as well.\n\nCausal Inference Engine: Directional Enrichment Analysis on Biological Networks.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Causal Inference Engine'",
