    "description": "A utility for collecting statistics from aligned and structurally annotated RNA sequences. It is a java utility intended to work with RNA structural alignments, including the motifs of stem-loops and pseudoknots. It can perform a variety of statistical analyses, and has editing capabilities intended to be useful with alignments that contain variable data such as the presence or absence of stem-loops or pseudoknots across sequences.",

                "abstract": "The study of RNA sequence structural alignments has become an important part of characterising noncoding RNAs. We developed RNApasta, a Java program with a graphical interface, to perform analysis and editing of RNA alignments. RNApasta can be used to generate statistics for modelling RNAs and to develop homogeneous subsets of alignments that contain variability. RNApasta includes several functions to characterise variation in stem and loop lengths, including phylogenetic analysis of this variation; as an example, we analyse variation in mir-31 pre-microRNA loop length variation, demonstrating that the sequences with longer loops had a single evolutionary origin.
