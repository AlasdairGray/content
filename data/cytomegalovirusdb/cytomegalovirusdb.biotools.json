In this work, we evaluated the whole genomes and proteomes of different CMV species and developed an integrated open-access platform, CytomegaloVirusDb, a multi-Omics knowledge database for Cytomegaloviruses. The resource is categorized into the main sections \u201cGenomics,\u201d \u201cProteomics,\u201d \u201cImmune response,\u201d and \u201cTherapeutics,\u201c. The database is annotated with the list of all CMV species included in the study, and available information is freely accessible at http://www.cmvdb.dqweilab-sjtu.com/index.php. Various parameters used in the analysis for each section were primarily based on the whole genome or proteome of each specie. The platform provided datasets are open to access for researchers to obtain CMV species-specific information. This will help further to explore the dynamics of CMV-specific immune response and therapeutics. This platform is a useful resource to aid in advancing research against Cytomegaloviruses.",
