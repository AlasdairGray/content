    "description": "Peroxiredoxin-5 (PRDX5) is a novel mammalian peroxiredoxin, belonging to the family of thiol-dependent peroxidases. It is structurally dissimilar from other peroxiredoxins in that it contains a conserved cysteine 47 residue at the N-terminus and a cysteine 151 residue at the C-terminus which form an intramolecular disulphide bridge and confers unique chemical characteristics to this enzyme. Peroxiredoxins protect cells from apoptosis induced by overexposure to endogenous or exogenous peroxides, such as peroxynitrites, hydrogen peroxide, and alkyl hydroperoxides. PRDX5 is widely expressed in various subcellular regions, including mitochondria, peroxisomes, nucleus, and cytosol.",
