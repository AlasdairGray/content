    "description": "Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is an antioxidant enzyme involved in the defense system against reactive oxygen species (ROS). SOD catalyzes the dismutation reaction of superoxide radical anion (O2-) to hydrogen peroxide, which is then catalyzed to innocuous O2 and H2O by glutathione peroxidase and catalase. Several classes of SOD have been identified. These include intracellular copper, zinc SOD (Cu, Zn-SOD/SOD-1), mitochondrial manganese SOD (Mn-SOD/SOD-2), and extracellular Cu, Zn-SOD (EC-SOD/SOD-3).",
