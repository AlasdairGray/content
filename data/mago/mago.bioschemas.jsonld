  "sc:description": "computational framework for high-quality production and large-scale evolutionary analysis of metagenome assembled genomes.\n\nMicrobial species play important roles in different environments and the production of high-quality genomes from metagenome datasets represents a major obstacle to understanding their ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Metagenome-Assembled Genomes Orchestra (MAGO) is a computational framework that integrates and simplifies metagenome assembly, binning, bin improvement, bin quality (completeness and contamination), bin annotation, and evolutionary placement of bins via detailed maximum-likelihood phylogeny based on multiple marker genes using different amino acid substitution models, next to average nucleotide identity analysis of genomes for delineation of species boundaries and operational taxonomic units",
