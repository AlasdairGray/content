  "sc:description": "An energy model for recognizing the prokaryotic promoters based on molecular structure.\n\nPromoter is an important functional elements of DNA sequences, which is in charge of gene transcription initiation. Recognizing promoter have important help for understanding the relative life phenomena. Based on the concept that promoter is mainly determined by its sequence and structure, a novel statistical physics model for predicting promoter in Escherichia coli K-12 is proposed. The total energies of DNA local structure of sequence segments in the three benchmark promoter sequence datasets, the sole prediction parameter, are calculated by using principles from statistical physics and information theory. The better results are obtained.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE BROKEN!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'physics model predicting promoter', 'PhysMPrePro predicting promoter'",
