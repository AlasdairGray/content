      "sc:description": "a comprehensive web platform of antimicrobial peptides tailored to the user's research.\n\nAntimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are part of the innate immune response to pathogens in all of the kingdoms of life. They have received significant attention because of their extraordinary variety of activities, in particular, as candidate drugs against the threat of super-bacteria. A systematic study of the relation between the sequence and the mechanism of action is urgently needed, given the thousands of sequences already in multiple web resources. ADAPTABLE web platform (http: gec.u-picardie.fr adaptable) introduces the concept of \"property alignment\" to create families of property and sequence-related peptides (SR families). This feature provides the researcher with a tool to select those AMPs meaningful to their research from among more than 40,000 nonredundant sequences.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'gec'",
