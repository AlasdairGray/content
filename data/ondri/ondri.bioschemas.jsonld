  "sc:description": "Ontario Neurodegenerative Disease Research Initiative (ONDRI).\n\nABSTRACT The Ontario Neurodegenerative Research Initiative (ONDRI) is a 3 year multi-site prospective cohort study that has acquired comprehensive multiple assessment platform data, including 3T structural MRI, from neurodegenerative patients with Alzheimer’s disease, mild cognitive impairment, Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, and cerebrovascular disease patients. This heterogeneous cross-section of patients with complex neurodegenerative and neurovascular pathologies pose significant challenges for standard neuroimaging tools. To effectively quantify regional measures of normal and pathological brain tissue volumes, the ONDRI neuroimaging platform implemented a semi-automated MRI processing pipeline that was able to address many of the challenges resulting from this heterogeneity.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Ontario Neurodegenerative Disease Research Initiative'",
