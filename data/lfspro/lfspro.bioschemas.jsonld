      "sc:description": "Penetrance of different cancer types in families with Li-Fraumeni syndrome.\n\nLi-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a rare hereditary cancer syndrome associated with an autosomal dominant mutation inheritance in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene and a wide spectrum of cancer diagnoses. The previously developed R package, LFSPRO, is capable of estimating the risk of an individual being a TP53 mutation carrier. However, an accurate estimation of the penetrance of different cancer types in LFS is crucial to improve the clinical characterization and management of high-risk individuals. Here, we developed a competing risk-based statistical model that incorporates the pedigree structure efficiently into the penetrance estimation and corrects for ascertainment bias while also increasing the effective sample size of this rare population.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
