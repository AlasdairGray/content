  description: utilities for the NCBI Sequence Read Archive
  long_description: " Tools for reading the SRA archive, generally by converting individual\
    \ runs\n into some commonly used format such as fastq.\n .\n The textual dumpers\
    \ \"sra-dump\" and \"vdb-dump\" are provided in this\n release as an aid in visual\
    \ inspection. It is likely that their\n actual output formatting will be changed\
    \ in the near future to a\n stricter, more formalized representation[s]. PLEASE\
    \ DO NOT RELY UPON\n THE OUTPUT FORMAT SEEN IN THIS RELEASE.\n .\n Other tools\
    \ distributed in this package are:\n  abi-dump, abi-load\n  align-info\n  bam-load\n\
    \  cache-mgr\n  cg-load\n  copycat\n  fasterq-dump\n  fastq-dump, fastq-load\n\
    \  helicos-load\n  illumina-dump, illumina-load\n  kar\n  kdbmeta\n  latf-load\n\
    \  pacbio-load\n  prefetch\n  rcexplain\n  remote-fuser\n  sff-dump, sff-load\n\
    \  sra-pileup, sra-sort, sra-stat, srapath\n  srf-load\n  test-sra\n  vdb-config,\
    \ vdb-copy, vdb-decrypt, vdb-encrypt, vdb-get, vdb-lock,\n  vdb-passwd, vdb-unlock,\
    \ vdb-validate\n .\n The \"help\" information will be improved in near future\
    \ releases, and\n the tool options will become standardized across the set. More\
    \ documentation\n will also be provided documentation on the NCBI web site.\n\
    \ .\n Tool options may change in the next release. Version 1 tool options\n will\
    \ remain supported wherever possible in order to preserve\n operation of any existing\
    \ scripts.\n"
