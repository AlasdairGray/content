    "description": "Hepatitis C Virus is a positive, single stranded RNA virus in the Flaviviridae family. The genome is approximately 10, 000 nucleotides and encodes a single polyprotein of about 3, 000 amino acids. The polyprotein is processed by host cell and viral proteases into three major structural proteins and several non structural proteins necessary for viral replication. Several different genotypes of HCV with slightly different genomic sequences have since been identified that correlate with differences in response to treatment with interferon alpha.",
