    "description": "CD154 (CD40 ligand, CD40L), a member of the TNF ligand family, is a 39-kDa type II transmembrane glycoprotein that was origionally identified on the surface of CD4 + T cells after T-cell antigen receptor activation. The natural receptor for CD40L is CD40, which is a transmembrane protein found on B cells, follicular dendritic cells, and macrophages. CD40\u2013CD40L interactions play an important role in B-cell proliferation, differentiation, and class-switch recombination (isotype class-switching).",
