      "sc:description": "Smart Process Optimization and Adaptive Execution with Semantic Services in Cloud Manufacturing â€¡.\n\nA new requirement for the manufacturing companies in Industry 4.0 is to be flexible with respect to changes in demands, requiring them to react rapidly and efficiently on the production capacities. Together with the trend to use Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA), this requirement induces a need for agile collaboration among supply chain partners, but also between different divisions or branches of the same company. In order to address this collaboration challenge, we~propose a novel pragmatic approach for the process analysis, implementation and execution. This~is achieved through sets of semantic annotations of business process models encoded into BPMN 2.0 extensions.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'manufacturing', 'Service-Oriented', 'BPMN', 'service-based'",
