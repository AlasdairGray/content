    "description": "Histones are lysine-rich and arginine-rich basic proteins of eukaryotic cells that provides structural support to a chromosome[1]. In order for very long DNA molecules to fit into the cell nucleus, they wrap around complexes of histone proteins, giving the chromosome a more compact shape. Some variants of histones are associated with the regulation of gene expression.",
