There are two workflows provided. First workflow for amplicon, using the standard mothur and dada2, and along with it some standard visualization are provided for the processed data. Second workflow for metagenomics, using a variety of tools openly available which have been stitched together to form a usable pipeline.\n\nBoth the workflows are controlled by bash scripts: amplicon_analysis.sh and metagenomics_analysis.sh.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'best-practice', 'microbiome' (bio.tools/microbiome), 'flood', 'binning'",
