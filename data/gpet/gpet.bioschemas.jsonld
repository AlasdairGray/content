  "sc:description": "a GPU-based, accurate and efficient Monte Carlo simulation tool for PET.\n\nMonte Carlo (MC) simulation method plays an essential role in the refinement and development of positron emission tomography (PET) systems. However, most existing MC simulation packages suffer from long execution time for practical PET simulations. To fully address this issue, we developed and validated gPET, a graphics processing unit (GPU)-based MC simulation tool for PET. gPET was built on the NVidia CUDA platform. The simulation process was modularized into three functional parts and carried out by the GPU parallel threads: (1) source management, including positron decay, transport and annihilation; (2) gamma transport inside the phantom; and (3) signal detection and processing inside the detector. A hybrid of voxelized (for patient phantoms) and parametrized (for detectors) geometries were employed to sufficiently support particle navigations.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
