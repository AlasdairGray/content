  description: PSORTb adapted library for svm machine-learning library (dev)
  long_description: " Libsvm is a machine-learning library which is an easy-to-use\
    \ package\n for support vector classification, regression and one-class SVM. It\n\
    \ supports multi-class classification, probability outputs, and\n parameter selection.\n\
    \ .\n PSORTb was featuring a code copy plus some local additions.  This\n library\
    \ is linked against the Debian packaged libsvn and just contains\n the PSORTb\
    \ extensions.\n .\n PSORTb enables prediction of bacterial protein subcellular\
    \ localization\n (SCL) and provides a quick and inexpensive means for gaining\
    \ insight\n into protein function, verifying experimental results, annotating\
    \ newly\n sequenced bacterial genomes, detecting potential cell surface/secreted\n\
    \ drug targets, as well as identifying biomarkers for microbes.\n .\n This library\
    \ needed by PSORTb is distributed separately by upstream.\n .\n This package contains\
    \ the static library which is needed to link PSORTb.\n"
