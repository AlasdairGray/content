Metaprogramming in R, thus the name.\n\nMetaR takes advantage of Language Workbench Technology to facilitate data analysis with the R language. It can be used by:.\n\nApache Server at metar.campagnelab.org Port 80.\n\nbioinformaticians who wish to package state of the art analysis methods into user friendly metaR analysis language constructs. MetaR can act as a bridge between analysis experts who develop analysis methods in R and wish to distribute these methods to the broadest audience without investing a lot of effort in developing user interfaces.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/goby_framework (CAMPAGNELAB.ORG)",
