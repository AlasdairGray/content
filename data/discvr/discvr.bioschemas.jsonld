  "sc:description": "> HOMEPAGE BROKEN! | Rapid viral diagnosis from high-throughput sequencing data | High-throughput sequencing (HTS) enables most pathogens in a clinical sample to be detected from a single analysis, thereby providing novel opportunities for diagnosis, surveillance, and epidemiology. However, this powerful technology is difficult to apply in diagnostic laboratories because of its computational and bioinformatic demands. We have developed DisCVR, which detects known human viruses in clinical samples by matching sample k-mers (twenty-two nucleotide sequences) to k-mers from taxonomically labeled viral genomes. DisCVR was validated using published HTS data for eighty-nine clinical samples from adults with upper respiratory tract infections. These samples had been tested for viruses metagenomically and also by real-time polymerase chain reaction assay, which is the standard diagnostic method",
