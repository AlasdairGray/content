    "description": "Giardia lamblia, also known as Giardia intestinalis and Giardia duodenalis, is a flagellated parasitic microorganism, that colonizes and reproduces in the small intestine, causing giardiasis. G. lamblia takes on two morphologically distinct forms during its life cycle. The replicative form is a motile pear-shaped cell that survives only in host small intestines called a trophozoite.",
