    "description": "Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) belongs to the genus Gammaretrovirus and is transmitted horizontally among domestic cats. This virus is known to induce various diseases such as lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndrome, anemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, and immune deficiency. The mechanisms by which this virus induces the multifarious symptoms of FeLV-associated diseases are still unclear; however, genetic polymorphisms resulting from substitution or recombination have led to changes in FeLV pathogenicity and unexpected symptoms.",
