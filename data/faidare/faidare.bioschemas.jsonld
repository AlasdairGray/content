It also provides a standard interface that can be accessed programatically through web services.\n\nIt is an extension of the generic DataDiscovery portal, a web portal that allows finding any type of data across several databases through a lightweight keyword based search. FAIDARE offers more detailed search and data retrieval capabilities and it takes advantage of the growing adoption of the BrAPI.",
