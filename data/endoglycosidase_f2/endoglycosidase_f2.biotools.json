    "description": "Selective release of biantennary and high mannose (at a 40X reduced rate) glycans from peptides and proteins.Endo F2 cleaves N-linked (asparagine-linked) biantennary oligosaccharides from glycoproteins. It also will cleave high mannose glycans but at a 40x reduced rate. It cleaves between the two N-acetylglucosamine residues in the diacetylchitobiose core of the oligosaccharide, generating a truncated sugar molecule with one N-acetylglucosamine residue remaining on the asparagine. In contrast, PNGase F removes the oligosaccharide intact.Endoglycosidase F2 is less sensitive to protein conformation than PNGase F and is therefore more suitable for deglycosylation of native proteins. However, for optimal results, denaturation of the glycoprotein is recommended.Additional Endo F Products:Endoglycosidase F1 releases bianatennary and some hybrid glycansEndoglycosidase F3 will release triantennarry and fucosylated biantennary N-glycans.",
