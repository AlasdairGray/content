As a patient-in-focus listing approach (PILA), it has been clinically validated (VALFORTA trial). Unlike drug-oriented listing approaches (DOLAs), its application requires knowledge of patients' characteristics, including diagnoses and other details. As a drug list with discrete labels, application of FORTA seems particularly amenable to electronic support. METHODS:An information technology (IT) algorithm was developed to analyze bulk data on International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-coded diseases and Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC)-coded drugs",
