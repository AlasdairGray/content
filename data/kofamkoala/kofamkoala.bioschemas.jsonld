K number assignments with scores above the predefined thresholds for individual KOs are more reliable than other proposed assignments. Such high score assignments are highlighted with asterisks '*' in the output. The K number assignments facilitate the interpretation of the annotation results by linking the user's sequence data to the KEGG pathways and EC numbers.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'SUMMARY:KofamKOALA'",
