      "sc:description": "a comprehensive database with multiple animal reference panels for genotype imputation.\n\nAnimal-ImputeDB (http: gong_lab.hzau.edu.cn Animal_ImputeDB ) is a public database with genomic reference panels of 13 animal species for online genotype imputation, genetic variant search, and free download. Genotype imputation is a process of estimating missing genotypes in terms of the haplotypes and genotypes in a reference panel. It can effectively increase the density of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and thus can be widely used in large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs) using relatively inexpensive and low-density SNP arrays. However, most animals except humans lack high-quality reference panels, which greatly limits the application of genotype imputation in animals.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE BROKEN!",
