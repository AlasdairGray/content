  "sc:description": "a web portal that brings 3-D QSAR to all electronic devices-the Py-CoMFA web application as tool to build models from pre-aligned datasets.\n\nThe underlying idea of any field-based 3-D QSAR is that differences in a target propriety, e.g., biological activity, are often closely related to equivalent changes in shapes and intensities of noncovalent calculated interaction surrounding the molecules (also called molecular interaction fields, MIFs).\n\nIf you are interested the subscription to the portal is free and you can sign up using the link you find in the left menu.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE '3-D QSAR'",
