    "description": "ANT2, also known as ADP/ATP translocase 2, ADP, ATP carrier protein 2, ADP, ATP carrier protein, fibroblast isoform, Adenine nucleotide translocator 2, ANT 2, Solute carrier family 25 members 5, and encoded by the gene symbol SLC25A5/ ANT2 is a member of the mitochondrial carrier (TC 2.A.29) family. ANT2 has been implied to catalyze the exchange of cytoplasmic ADP with mitochondrial ATP across the mitochondrial inner membrane. As part of the mitotic spindle-associated MMXD complex, ANT2 may play a role in chromosome segregation.",
