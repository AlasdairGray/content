                "abstract": "High-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry has been used to identify the outer membrane (OM) subproteome of the Gram-negative bacterium Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath). Twenty-eight unique polypeptide sequences were identified from protein samples enriched in OMs. Only six of these polypeptides had previously been identified. The predictions from novel bioinformatic methods predicting β-barrel outer membrane proteins (OMPs) and OM lipoproteins were compared to proteins identified experimentally. BOMP (http://www.bioinfo.no/tools/ bomp) predicted 43 β-barrel OMPs (1.45%) from the 2,959 annotated open reading frames. This was a lower percentage than predicted from other Gram-negative proteomes (1.8-3%). More than half of the predicted BOMPs in M. capsulatus were annotated as (conserved) hypothetical proteins with significant similarity to very few sequences in Swiss-Prot or TrEMBL. The experimental data and the computer predictions indicated that the protein composition of the M. capsulatus OM subproteome was different from that of other Gram-negative bacteria studied in a similar manner. A new program, Lipo, was developed that can analyse entire predicted proteomes and give a list of recognised lipoproteins categorised according to their lipo-box similarity to known Gram-negative lipoproteins (http:// www.bioinfo.no/tools/lipo). This report is the first using a proteomics and bioinformatics approach to identify the OM subproteome of an obligate methanotroph. © Springer-Verlag 2005.",
