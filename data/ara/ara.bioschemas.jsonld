  "sc:description": "accurate, reliable and active histopathological image classification framework with Bayesian deep learning.\n\nThis repository contains an implementation of ARA-CNN - a Bayesian deep learning model intended for histopathological image classification.\n\nARA stands for Accurate, Reliable and Active. Any method that works on patient data needs to be accurate and reliable, meaning that in addition to very high classification accuracy it should also provide a measure of uncertainty for each prediction. ARA-CNN adheres to these requirements. Moreover, the uncertainty measurement can be used as an acquisition function in active learning, which significantly speeds up the learning process on new histopathological datasets. Uncertainty can also be used to identify mislabelled training images",
