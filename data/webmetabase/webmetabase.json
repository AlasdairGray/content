Many enzymatic barriers should be crossed by a successful drug to be prosperous in such a process. Therefore, the new peptide drugs must be designed preventing the potential protease cleavage to make the compound less susceptible to protease reaction. We present a new data analysis tool developed in WebMetabase, an approach that stores the information from liquid chromatography mass spectrometry-based experimental data or from external sources such as the MEROPS database. The tool is a chemically aware system where each peptide substrate is presented as a sequence of structural blocks (SBs) connected by amide bonds and not being limited to the natural amino acids. Each SB is characterized by its pharmacophoric and physicochemical properties including a similarity score that describes likelihood between a SB and each one of the other SBs in the database. This methodology can be used to perform a frequency analysis to discover the most frequent cleavage sites for similar amide bonds, defined based on the similarity of the SB that participate in such a bond within the experimentally derived and/or public database.",
