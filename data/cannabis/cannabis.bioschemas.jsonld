Error tolerant alignment is coming soon.\n\nWe are currently constructing protein FASTA databases for use in Cannabis proteomics. The lack of annotated sequences has impeded the study of Cannabis. We have worked to create a resource to enable and advance future research.\n\nWe have utilized high pressure ultra high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-MS MS) to acquire millions of mass spectra from proteins of dozens of cannabis materials.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/CannabisDraftMap (CANNABISDRAFTMAP.ORG).\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Draft Map'",
