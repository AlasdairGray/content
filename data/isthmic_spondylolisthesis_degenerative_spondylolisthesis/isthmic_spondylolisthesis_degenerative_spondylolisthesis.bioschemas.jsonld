  "sc:description": "Association of MRI-defined lumbar paraspinal muscle mass and slip percentage in degenerative and isthmic spondylolisthesis.\n\nThe objective of this study is to investigate the role of paraspinal muscles in the progression of different types of spondylolisthesis by examining the correlation between cross-sectional area (CSA) of lumbar paraspinal muscle and slip percentage (SP) in degenerative spondylolisthesis and isthmic spondylolisthesis. A multicenter retrospective analysis was carried out including 219 subjects diagnosed with lumbar spondylolisthesis. Using T2-weighted axial magnetic resonance imgaging, CSAs of the psoas major (PM), multifidus (MU), and erector spinae were measured and divided by L5 vertebral body (VB) CSA. SP was measured using sagittal T2-weighted images.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'spondylolisthesis degenerative spondylolisthesis', 'isthmic spondylolisthesis', 'isthmic spondylolisthesis degenerative', 'VB'",
