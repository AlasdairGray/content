    "description": "Corning Carbo-BIND 96 well microplates have a hydrazide surface that covalently couples to carbohydrate groups; ideal for assays requiring site-directed orientation of a particular biomolecule hile maintaining enzymatic or immunological activity. In addition, minimal surface preparation is required prior to conducting assays.",
