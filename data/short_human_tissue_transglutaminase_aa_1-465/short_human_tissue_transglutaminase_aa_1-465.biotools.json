    "description": "Short rhTG2 is a truncated variant of TG2 lacking both \u00df-barrel domains. The protein was expressed in E. coli based on the TGM2-allele from I.M.A.G.E.-clone IMAGp958L121020 isolated from neuroblastoma cells of the human brain (Val224-allele, Kanchan et al., Biochem. J. 2013, 455:261\u201372). It is N-terminally fused to a hexahistidine-tag. Short rhTG2 was purified by ion metal chelating chromatography (IMAC).",
