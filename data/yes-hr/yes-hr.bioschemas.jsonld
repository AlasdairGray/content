  "sc:description": "Adapting an evidence-based positive youth development intervention to prevent sexual and teen dating violence.\n\nAdapting evidence-based interventions (EBIs) guided by implementation science frameworks is a promising way to accelerate the translation of effective violence prevention in schools. School-based interventions offer an opportunity to reduce the risk of multiple forms of violence, including sexual violence (SV) and teen dating violence (TDV). EBIs in schools reach large populations of adolescents, including those underserved in other settings. Although specific SV TDV prevention programs exist, evaluations indicate limited effectiveness over time.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE BROKEN!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'YES-HR school-based', 'YES', 'TDV', 'frameworks'",
