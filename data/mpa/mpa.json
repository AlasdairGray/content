There is not a currently simple way to make easy comparisons of data from multiple proteome profiles and yet most experiments contain more than two samples. MPA has been developed to answer these needs and ease the work of users in multiple comparisons among profiles data. MPA has been specifically developed on the basis of the output data produced by the ProteomLab PF2D platform but, in principle, is able to align peaks of chromatographic profiles coming from other sources. The tool has been designed to work in two main modes. The first is more conservative and performs a comparison among acquired pairwise alignments (i.e. using DeltaVue software) given by a profile, chosen as control, against profiles from different experimental conditions.",

To accomplish semiautomatic protein separations based on 2-D LC, the Beckman Coulter PF2D has been developed. Here, we present a novel general purpose tool called MPA (multiple peak alignment) able to perform multiple comparisons of proteomic profiles both in a pairwise guided fashion and in a fully automatic mode using a strategy based on dynamic programing and progressive alignment of time series. The tool is available at http://grup.cribi.unipd.it/people/stefano/mpa/. Â© 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.",
