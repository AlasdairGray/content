  "sc:description": "A Monte Carlo Based Protocol for the Estimation of Absolute Binding Free Energies.\n\nIn this study, we present a fully automatic platform based on our Monte Carlo algorithm, the Protein Energy Landscape Exploration method (PELE), for the estimation of absolute protein-ligand binding free energies, one of the most significant challenges in computer aided drug design. Based on a ligand pathway approach, an initial short enhanced sampling simulation is performed to identify reasonable starting positions for more extended sampling. This stepwise approach allows for a significant faster convergence of the free energy estimation using the Markov State Model (MSM) technique. PELE-MSM was applied on four diverse protein and ligand systems, successfully ranking compounds for two systems. Based on the results, current limitations and challenges with physics-based methods in computational structural biology are discussed.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
