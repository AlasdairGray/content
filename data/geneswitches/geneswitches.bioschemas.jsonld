  "sc:description": "Ordering gene-expression and functional events in single-cell experiments.\n\nData-driven Network Biology Group.\n\nThe goal of GeneSwitches is to discover the order of gene-expression and functional events during cell state transitions at a single-cell resolution. It works on any single-cell trajectory or pseudo-time ordering of cells to discover the genes that act as on/off switches between cell states and importantly the ordering at which these switches take place.\n\nIn the past hypothesis-driven research in the life sciences has been the domain of experimental biologists, with the role of biostatisticians and bioinformaticians being one of support.\n\nOur primary research interest is in understanding how genes and drugs can coordinate changes in cellular phenotypes and we use this to treat disease directly or initiate transdifferentiations that can underpin cell therapy.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/adsn (DDNETBIO.COM)",
