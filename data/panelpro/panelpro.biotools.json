All rights reserved.Identifying individuals who are at high risk of cancer due to inherited germline mutations is critical for e ective implementation of personalized prevention strategies. Most existing models focus on a few speci c syndromes; however recent evidence from multi-gene panel testing shows that many syndromes are overlapping, motivating the development of models that incorporate family history on several cancers and predict mutations for a comprehensive panel of genes. We present PanelPRO, a new, open-source R package providing a fast, exible back-end for multi-gene, multi-cancer risk modeling with pedigree data. It includes a customizable database with default parameter values estimated from published studies and allows users to select any combinations of genes and cancers for their models, including well-established single syndrome BayesMendel models (BRCAPRO and MMRPRO). This leads to more accurate risk predictions and ultimately has a high impact on prevention strategies for cancer and clinical decision making. The package is available for download for research purposes at https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/bayesmendel/panelpro.",
