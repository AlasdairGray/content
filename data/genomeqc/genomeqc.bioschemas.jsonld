It also benchmarks user supplied assemblies and annotations against the publicly available reference genomes of their choice. It is optimized for small and medium sized genomes (<2.5 Gb) and has pre-computed results for several maize genomes.\n\nGenome Assembly and Annotation Metrics.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/MaizeDIG (MAIZEGDB.ORG), bio.tools/snpversity (MAIZEGDB.ORG), bio.tools/maizegdb (MAIZEGDB.ORG)",
