    "description": "VAPOR is a tool for classification of Influenza samples from raw short read sequence data for downstream bioinformatics analysis. VAPOR is provided with a fasta file of full-length sequences (> 20,000) for a given segment, a set of reads, and attempts to retrieve a reference that is closest to the sample strain.",

                "abstract": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2019.Motivation: Influenza viruses represent a global public health burden due to annual epidemics and pandemic potential. Due to a rapidly evolving RNA genome, inter-species transmission, intra-host variation, and noise in short-read data, reads can be lost during mapping, and de novo assembly can be time consuming and result in misassembly. We assessed read loss during mapping and designed a graph-based classifier, VAPOR, for selecting mapping references, assembly validation and detection of strains of non-human origin. Results: Standard human reference viruses were insufficient for mapping diverse influenza samples in simulation. VAPOR retrieved references for 257 real whole-genome sequencing samples with a mean of > 99:8% identity to assemblies, and increased the proportion of mapped reads by up to 13.3% compared to standard references. VAPOR has the potential to improve the robustness of bioinformatics pipelines for surveillance and could be adapted to other RNA viruses.",
