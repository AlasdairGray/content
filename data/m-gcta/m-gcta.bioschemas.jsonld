Your ideas and suggestions are always welcome! | M-GCTA is an user-friendly software package, which can be used to estimate the proportion of phenotypic variance due to tagged maternal (or paternal) and offspring genetic effects on offspring phenotypes using large studies where genome-wide genotype data are available on mother- (or father-) offspring pairs",
