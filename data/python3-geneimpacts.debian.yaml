  description: wraps command line tools to assess variants in gene sequences
  long_description: " Interpersonal differences in DNA is responsible for variations\
    \ in\n response to external stimuli, the efficiency of metabolism or\n may even\
    \ cause what is referenced as a genetic disorder.\n .\n A range of tools have\
    \ been created to predict the importance of\n differences (polymorphisms) in genetic\
    \ sequences at single nucleotides,\n SNPs.  This Python class wraps and represents\
    \ findings provided by any\n of the tools snpEff, VEP and BCFT.\n"
