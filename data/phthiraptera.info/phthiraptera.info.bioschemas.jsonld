      "sc:description": "Ecological interactions in the Scratchpads virtual research environment.\n\nLice ( Insecta : Phthiraptera ) are permanent, obligate ectoparasites of birds and mammals. Three of the suborders ( Amblycera , Ischnocera and Rhynchophthirina ) are known as chewing or biting lice, and the fourth ( Anoplura ) form the sucking lice. There are about 5,000 known species, present on roughly 4,000 species of bird and 800 mammal. Most are highly host specific, and consequently lice are present in every continent and virtually every habitat occupied by birds and mammals.\n\nThis website is a collection or digital resources on parasitic lice.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Phthiraptera.info Scratchpad', 'Scratchpads', 'Scratchpads VRE'",
