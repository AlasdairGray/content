    "description": "GFAP, a member of the cytoskeletal protein family, is the principal 8-9 nm intermediate filament in mature astrocytes of the central nervous system (CNS). GFAP is a monomeric molecule with a MW between 40 and 53 kDa and an IP between 5.7 and 5.8. It is a class-III intermediate filament majorly expressed in astrocytic glial cells in the central nervous system. GFAP is also expressed, however, in a restricted subset of epithelial tumors, including salivary gland pleomorphic adenomas.",
