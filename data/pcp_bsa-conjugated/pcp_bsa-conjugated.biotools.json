    "description": "PCP works primarily as an NMDA receptorantagonist, which blocks the activity of the NMDA receptor and, like mostantiglutamatergic hallucinogens, is significantly more dangerous than othercategories of hallucinogens. Other NMDA receptor antagonists includeketamine, tiletamine, dextromethorphan and nitrous oxide. Although theprimary psychoactive effects of the drug lasts for a few hours, the totalelimination rate from the body typically extends eight days or longer.As arecreational drug, PCP may be ingested, smoked, or snorted. Phencyclidine modulates secretogranin II[sg II] expression inprefrontal cortex tissue in the absence of afferent inputs. The nature ofthese changes is dependent upon the duration of exposure to and/or withdrawalfrom phencyclidine. It is used as an anesthetic by veterinarians and isillicitly taken for its hallucinogen effects.",
