  "sc:description": "Exploring open cheminformatics approaches for categorizing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs).\n\nClassyFire is a web-based application for automated structural classification of chemical entities. This application uses a rule-based approach that relies on a comprehensible, comprehensive, and computable chemical taxonomy. ClassyFire provides a hierarchical chemical classification of chemical entities (mostly small molecules and short peptide sequences), as well as a structure-based textual description, based on a chemical taxonomy named ChemOnt, which covers 4825 chemical classes of organic and inorganic compounds. It can be accessed via the web interface or via the ClassyFire API.\n\nClassyFire is offered to the public as a freely acessible web server.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'PFASs', 'categorizing PFASs', 'splitPFAS', 'naming PFASs'",
