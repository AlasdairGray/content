      "sc:description": "A Novel Health Education Mobile Application for Mothers Who Have Experienced Intimate Partner Violence.\n\nIntimate partner violence (IPV) has well-documented adverse impact on survivors and their children. In this article, we describe the development and formative evaluation of a trauma-informed, user-friendly Smartphone-based mobile application (app) to address the unmet health needs and improve the well-being of mothers who have experienced IPV. A multidisciplinary team of IPV experts developed the app (called Thrive) in partnership with software developers. Thrive includes three sections: Myself (maternal self-care, stress coping skills), My Child (stress signs in children, talking to children about IPV, mother-child dyadic communication), and My Life (hospital- and community-based resources). Sixteen providers (social workers, IPV advocates, and health care providers) and eight IPV survivors provided feedback about Thrive via structured interviews.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
