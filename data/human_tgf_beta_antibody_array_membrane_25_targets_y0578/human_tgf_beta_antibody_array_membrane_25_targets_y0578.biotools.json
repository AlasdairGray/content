    "description": "Antibody array is a specific form of protein microarray. In this technology, capture antibodies spotted on membranes or glass slide bind to specific target proteins present in the sample. Captured proteins are visualized using chemiluminescent or Laser Scanner. The signal produced is proportional to the amount of analyte bound. The product provided herein is a Human TGF beta Antibody Array, which can be used for semi-quantitative detection of 25 human TGF beta proteins. It is suitable for a range of liquid forms including Cell culture supernatants, Cell lysates, Plasma, Serum and Tissue lysates.",
