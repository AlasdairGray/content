    "description": "Each set of the centrifuge empty column tube contains a 2 ml capacity outer tube, a 1 ml capacity inner tube and a 20\u03bcm pore size high molecular polyethylene sieve plate. The outer tube and inner tube are made of high-purity polypropylene (the same material as various commonly used EP tubes), the height of the cylinder is 23.6mm, and the inner diameter of the cylinder is 7.2mm, which has extremely low adsorption of various biomolecules.",
