Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Accurate identification of bitter peptides is of great importance for better understanding their biochemical and biophysical properties. To date, machine learning\u2010based methods have be-come effective approaches for providing a good avenue for identifying potential bitter peptides from large\u2010scale protein datasets. Although few machine learning\u2010based predictors have been developed for identifying the bitterness of peptides, their prediction performances could be improved. In this study, we developed a new predictor (named iBitter\u2010Fuse) for achieving more accurate identification of bitter peptides. In the proposed iBitter\u2010Fuse, we have integrated a variety of feature encoding schemes for providing sufficient information from different aspects, namely consisting of compositional information and physicochemical properties. To enhance the predictive perfor-mance, the customized genetic algorithm utilizing self\u2010assessment\u2010report (GA\u2010SAR) was employed for identifying informative features followed by inputting optimal ones into a support vector machine (SVM)\u2010based classifier for developing the final model (iBitter\u2010Fuse). Benchmarking experi-ments based on both 10\u2010fold cross\u2010validation and independent tests indicated that the iBitter\u2010Fuse was able to achieve more accurate performance as compared to state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art methods. To facili-tate the high\u2010throughput identification of bitter peptides, the iBitter\u2010Fuse web server was established and made freely available online. It is anticipated that the iBitter\u2010Fuse will be a useful tool for aiding the discovery and de novo design of bitter peptides.",
