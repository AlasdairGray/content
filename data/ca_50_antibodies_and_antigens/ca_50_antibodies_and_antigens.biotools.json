    "description": "Carbohydrate antigen 50 (CA 50) which can be detected by monoclonal antibodies is a non-specific carbohydrate tumor marker. CA50 is commonly associated with gastrointestinal tumors, such as pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer and biliary tract cancer. Moreover, it has been reported that the elevation of CA50 could be found in other carcinomas besides of gastrointestinal tumors, such as non-small cell lung cancer, papillary thyroid carcinoma and myelodysplastic syndrome.",
