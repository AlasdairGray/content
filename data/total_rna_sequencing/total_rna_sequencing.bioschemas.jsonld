  "sc:description": "CD genomics combines proven ribosomal reduction library preparation chemistries and illumina NGS technology into a single, streamlined protocol. Ribo-Zero ribosomal RNA reduction chemistry minimizes ribosomal contamination and maximizes the percentage of uniquely mapped reads. With the consistent robust performance, total RNA-seq covers both mRNA and a broad range of ncRNA species of interest, including long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), small nuclear (snRNA), small nucleolar (snoRNA), and other RNA species.",
