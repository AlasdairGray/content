    "description": "CD Genomics has further optimized the process to exceed PacBio\u2019s benchmarks in output and read length to support long-read metagenomic sequencing, and reduce some splicing errors and effectively improve the resolution of microbial community profiling. PacBio System is highly robust and cost-effective and should be the platform of choice in metagenomics sequencing , particularly for complex sample and low-diversity microbial communities. CD Genomics will be your best companion in long-read metagenomic sequencing. Please contact us for more information and a detailed quote.",
