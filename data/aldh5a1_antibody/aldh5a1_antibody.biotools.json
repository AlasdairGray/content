    "description": "Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) mediate the NADP+-dependent oxidation of aldehydes into acids and play an important role in the detoxification of alcohol-derived acetaldehyde, as well as in lipid peroxidation and in the metabolism of corticosteroids, biogenic amines and neurotransmitters. ALDH5A1 (aldehyde dehydrogenase 5 family, member A1), also known as SSDH or SSADH, is a 535 amino acid protein that localizes to the mitochondria and belongs to the aldehyde dehydrogenase family. Expressed in a variety of tissues, including liver, heart, lung, brain, kidney and placenta, ALDH5A1 is required for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) recycling from the synaptic cleft. Mutations of ALDH5A1 lead to succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency (SSADH deficiency) that is characterized by severe ataxia and by mildly retarded psychomotor development.",
