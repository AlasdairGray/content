    "description": "UMIc is an alignment free framework serving as a pre-processing step of FASTQ files for deduplication and correction of reads building consensus sequences from each UMI. The tool takes into account the frequency and the Phred quality of nucleotides and the distances between the UMIs and the actual sequences, and produces FASTQ files that contain the corrected sequences (without the UMI) and their quality.",
