The tool takes into account the frequency and the Phred quality of nucleotides and the distances between the UMIs and the actual sequences, and produces FASTQ files that contain the corrected sequences (without the UMI) and their quality.",

A UMI adds a unique identity to different DNA/RNA input molecules through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, thus reducing bias of this step. Here, we propose an alignment free framework serving as a preprocessing step of fastq files, called UMIc, for deduplication and correction of reads building consensus sequences from each UMI. Our approach takes into account the frequency and the Phred quality of nucleotides and the distances between the UMIs and the actual sequences. We have tested the tool using different scenarios of UMI-tagged library data, having in mind the aspect of a wide application. UMIc is an open-source tool implemented in R and is freely available from https://github.com/BiodataAnalysisGroup/UMIc.",
