  "sc:description": "Structural and biochemical analysis of Bacillus anthracis prephenate dehydrogenase reveals an unusual mode of inhibition by tyrosine via the ACT domain.\n\nIntegrated Resource for Reproducibility in Macromolecular Crystallography.\n\nThis project is being funded by the Targeted Software Development award 1 U01 HG008424-01 as part of the BD2K (Big Data to Knowledge) program of the National Institute of Health. The project is developing tools for \"wrangling\" data from protein diffraction experiments. We are also creating a growing repository of diffraction experiments used to determine protein structures in the PDB, contributed by the CSGID, SSGCID, JCSG, MCSG, SGC, and other large-scale projects, as well as individual research laboratories.\n\nCurrently indexed projects: 5368.\n\nCurrently indexed datasets: 8692.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'BaPDH', 'prephenate', '6U60 BaPDH', '5V0S BaPDH'",
