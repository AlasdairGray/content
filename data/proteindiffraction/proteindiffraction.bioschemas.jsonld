The project is developing tools for \"wrangling\" data from protein diffraction experiments. We are also creating a growing repository of diffraction experiments used to determine protein structures in the PDB, contributed by the CSGID, SSGCID, JCSG, MCSG, SGC, and other large-scale projects, as well as individual research laboratories.\n\nCurrently indexed projects: 5368.\n\nCurrently indexed datasets: 8692.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'BaPDH', 'prephenate', '6U60 BaPDH', '5V0S BaPDH'",
