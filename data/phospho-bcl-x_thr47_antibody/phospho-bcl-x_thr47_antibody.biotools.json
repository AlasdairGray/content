    "description": "Bcl-x is a dominant regulator of programmed cell death in mammalian cells. Members of the wider Bcl-2 family, which also includes Bcl-x, Bcl-w and Mcl-1, are described by their similarity to Bcl-2 protein. Bcl-x an antiapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family is a dominant regulator of programmed cell death in mammalian cells. Bcl-x is located at the outer mitochondrial membrane and regulates outer mitochondrial membrane channel (VDAC) opening. The long form (Bcl-x (L)) displays cell death repressor activity, but the short isoform (Bcl-x(S)) and the b-isoform (Bcl-xb) promote cell death.",
