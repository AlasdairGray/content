  "sc:description": "predictor for cellular protein stability.\n\nTool for classification of protein variations predictor.\n\nA benchmark database for variations.\n\nDatasets for training and testing cellular protein stability predictor ProTstab:.\n\nStability of biomolecules, especially of proteins, is of great interest and significance. Protein stability has been the major target for protein engineering, mainly to increase the stability, but sometimes also to destabilize proteins . Effects on stability are among the most common consequences for disease-related variations , thus this phenomenon is of interest for variation interpretation to explain the effects of harmful variants.\n\nWe trained a novel machine learning tool for prediction of protein stability, especially melting temperature Tm. The tool is based on amino acid sequence information and using GBRT (Gradient boosting of regression trees) algorithm.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/VariBench (BMC.LU.SE/VariBench)",
