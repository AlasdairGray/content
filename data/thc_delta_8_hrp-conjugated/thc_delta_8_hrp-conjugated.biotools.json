    "description": "The agents of Marijuana that cause various biological effects in humans are called cannabinoid. Cannabinoid is a central nervous stimulant that alters mood and sensory perceptions, produces loss of coordination, impairs short term memory, produces symptoms of anxiety, paranoia, depression, confusion, hallucination, and increased heart rate. Large doses of cannabinoid could cause the development of tolerances and physiological dependency and lead to abuse. A tolerance to the cardiac and psychotropic effects can occur and withdrawal syndrome produces restlessness, insomnia, anorexia and nausea. \u03949-THC is the primary active ingredient in cannabinoids.",
