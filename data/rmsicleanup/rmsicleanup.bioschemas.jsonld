      "sc:description": "An open-source tool for matrix-related peak annotation in mass spectrometry imaging and its application to silver-assisted laser desorption/ionization.\n\nAutomated annotation of matrix-related signals in MSI.\n\nrMSIcleanup is an open-source R package to annotate matrix-related signals in MSI data. The algorithm takes into account the chemical formula and the spatial distribution to determine which ions are matrix-related. The algorithm incorporates an overlapping peak detection feature to prevent misclassification of overlapped or isobaric ions. Additionally, the package generates a visual report to transparently justify each annotation",
