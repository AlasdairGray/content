  "sc:description": "Nucleus segmentation across imaging experiments.\n\nDeep Retina 3th place solution to Kaggle's 2018 Data Science Bowl.\n\nThis solution is based on Matterport's Mask_RCNN implementation on keras/tensorflow. Please look at the original repository (https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) for specific details. This is an implementation of Mask R-CNN on Python 3, Keras, and TensorFlow. The model generates bounding boxes and segmentation masks for each instance of an object in the image. It's based on Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and a ResNet101 backbone. I have used the pretrained COCO weights as the starting point for my training on the nuclei segmentation dataset.\n\nFind the nuclei in divergent images to advance medical discovery.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Nucleus segmentation across imaging experiments', 'Bowl', 'configuration-free', 'deep-learning-based'",
