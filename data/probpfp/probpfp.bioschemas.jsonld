  "sc:description": "a multiple sequence alignment algorithm combining hidden Markov model optimized by particle swarm optimization with partition function.\n\nBACKGROUND:During procedures for conducting multiple sequence alignment, that is so essential to use the substitution score of pairwise alignment. To compute adaptive scores for alignment, researchers usually use Hidden Markov Model or probabilistic consistency methods such as partition function. Recent studies show that optimizing the parameters for hidden Markov model, as well as integrating hidden Markov model with partition function can raise the accuracy of alignment. The combination of partition function and optimized HMM, which could further improve the alignment's accuracy, however, was ignored by these researches. RESULTS:A novel algorithm for MSA called ProbPFP is presented in this paper. It intergrate optimized HMM by particle swarm with partition function.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
