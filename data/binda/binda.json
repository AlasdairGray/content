However, differential proteomics and identification of peaks relevant for class separation remains challenging. Results: Here, we introduce a simple yet effective approach for identifying differentially expressed proteins using binary discriminant analysis. This approach works by data-adaptive thresholding of protein expression values and subsequent ranking of the dichotomized features using a relative entropy measure. Our framework may be viewed as a generalization of the 'peak probability contrast' approach of Tibshirani et al. (2004) and can be applied both in the two-group and the multi-group setting. Our approach is computationally inexpensive and shows in the analysis of a large-scale drug discovery test dataset equivalent prediction accuracy as a random forest. Furthermore, we were able to identify in the analysis of mass spectrometry data from a pancreas cancer study biological relevant and statistically predictive marker peaks unrecognized in the original study.",
