Look no further! We can help you find CRISPR guide designs (both -NGG and -NAG) in Fly, Human, Mouse, Zebrafish, and Rat genomes. Each guide will be given an efficiency and off-target score based on our algorithms so that you can plan accordingly. Targeting multiple variants within the same guide is also available (select the checkbox)!.\n\nOnline version available at: https://www.flyrnai.org/tools/snp_crispr.\n\nDRSC tool for search and view of pre-computed CRISPR designs for genome engineering (knock-out or knock-in) in Drosophila.\n\nDRSC/TRiP Functional Genomics Resources.\n\nâ€” Rational design of CRISPR/Cas target.\n\nEnter an accession number (e.g",
