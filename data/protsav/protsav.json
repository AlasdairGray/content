A highly efficient quality assessment of predicted model structures directs further research on function. Here we present a new server ProTSAV, capable of evaluating predicted model structures based on some popular online servers and standalone tools. ProTSAV furnishes the user with a single quality score in case of individual protein structure along with a graphical representation and ranking in case of multiple protein structure assessment. The server is validated on ∼ 64,446 protein structures including experimental structures from RCSB and predicted model structures for CASP targets and from public decoy sets. ProTSAV succeeds in predicting quality of protein structures with a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 98% on experimentally solved structures and achieves a specificity of 88%and a sensitivity of 91% on predicted protein structures of CASP11 targets under 2 Å.The server overcomes the limitations of any single server/method and is seen to be robust in helping in quality assessment. ProTSAV is freely available at http://www.scfbio-iitd.res.in/software/proteomics/protsav.jsp.",
