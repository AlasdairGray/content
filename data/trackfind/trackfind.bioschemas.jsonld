  "sc:description": "TrackFind is a FAIR genomic tracks search and curation engine. It supports crawling of the TrackHub Registry and other data portals to fetch track metadata. Crawled metadata can be accessed through hierarchical browsing or by search queries, both through a web-based user interface and as a RESTful API. TrackFind supports advanced SQL-based search queries that can be easily built in the user interface, and the search results can be browsed and exported in JSON or GSuite format. The RESTful API allows downstream tools and scripts to easily integrate TrackFind search, currently demonstrated by the GSuite HyperBrowser and EPICO.",
