  "sc:description": "the database of proteins driving liquid-liquid phase separation.\n\nPhaSePro is the comprehensive database of proteins driving liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in living cells. LLPS is a molecular process employed by all living organisms to form membraneless organelles, mediating crucial cellular functions. PhaSePro is manually curated, it is solely based on experimentally verified cases of LLPS, integrating a wide range of information on the biophysical driving forces, biological function and regulation of these molecular systems.\n\nThe table below lists all cases where the involvement in LLPS is indicated by some evidence, but where there isnâ€™t enough available experimental information for inclusion into the core dataset of PhaSePro.\n\nEntering text in the fields above columns lists all matching items.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/bestsel (ELTE.HU)",
