                "abstract": "Copyright 2021 Huang et al.With the accumulation of data on 6mA modification sites, an increasing number of scholars have begun to focus on the identification of 6mA sites. Despite the recognized importance of 6mA sites, methods for their identification remain lacking, with most existing methods being aimed at their identification in individual species. In the present study, we aimed to develop an identification method suitable for multiple species. Based on previous research, we propose a method for 6mA site recognition. Our experiments prove that the proposed 6mA-Pred method is effective for identifying 6mA sites in genes from taxa such as rice, Mus musculus, and human. A series of experimental results show that 6mA-Pred is an excellent method. We provide the source code used in the study, which can be obtained from http://39. 100.246.211:5004/6mA_Pred/.",
