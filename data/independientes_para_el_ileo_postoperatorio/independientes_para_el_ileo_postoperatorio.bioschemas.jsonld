OBJECTIVE:The purpose of this study was to analyze the impact of perioperative fluid management on ileus occurrence after colorectal surgery within a fully implemented enhanced recovery pathway. DESIGN:This was a retrospective cohort study of a prospectively maintained institutional database. SETTINGS:The study was conducted at a tertiary academic facility with fully implemented standardized enhanced recovery pathway over the entire study period. PATIENTS:All of the consecutive elective major colorectal resections for benign or malign indications between 2011 and 2016 were included.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'B54', 'El ileo postoperatorio', 'para el ileo postoperatorio', 'riesgo independientes para el ileo'",
