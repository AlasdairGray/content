  "sc:description": "Clustering of genetic variants in Mendelian randomization with similar causal estimates.\n\nR package for investigating clustered heterogeneity in Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses.\n\nmr_clust_em - performs expectation-maximisation (EM) based model fitting of the MR-Clust mixture model.\n\nGenetic variants which recover similar estimates of the causal effect of the risk-factor on the outcome - i.e. their ratio-estimates are similar in direction, magnitude and precision - can form distinct clusters in MR analyses. We call this `clustered heterogeneity'. Each cluster might represent a distinct pathway with which the risk-factor is related to the outcome and hence clustered heterogeneity is interesting to investigate as the identity of the genetic variants in the clusters may reveal information about the risk factor and how it relates to the outcome",
