The initial version includes 23 angiosperm species with 17 eudicots and 6 monocots and was extended by including additional 10 species in January 2014. The collection will be extended in the future as soon as more annotated whole genome sequencing projects will become available.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'HSF', 'radish', 'HSFs', 'radish abiotic'",
