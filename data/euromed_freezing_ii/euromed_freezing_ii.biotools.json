    "description": "Mammalian and insect cells are cryopreserved for a variety of reason. These include long-term storage, to minimise genetic changes in cell lines that are continuous thereby avoiding transformation of a cell line and to avoid loss of cells by contamination. It is very important that the correct type of cryopreservative is used to ensure successful cryopreservation and recovery.",
