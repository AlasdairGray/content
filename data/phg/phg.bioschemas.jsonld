  "sc:description": "A sorghum Practical Haplotype Graph facilitates genome-wide imputation and cost-effective genomic prediction.\n\nAbstract Successful management and utilization of increasingly large genomic datasets is essential for breeding programs to increase genetic gain and accelerate cultivar development. To help with data management and storage, we developed a sorghum Practical Haplotype Graph (PHG) pangenome database that stores all identified haplotypes and variant information for a given set of individuals. We developed two PHGs in sorghum, one with 24 individuals and another with 398 individuals, that reflect the diversity across genic regions of the sorghum genome. 24 founders of the Chibas sorghum breeding program were sequenced at low coverage (0.01x) and processed through the PHG to identify genome-wide variants. The PHG called SNPs with only 5.9% error at 0.01x coverage - only 3% lower than its accuracy when calling SNPs from 8x coverage sequence",
