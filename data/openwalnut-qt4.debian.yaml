  description: Multi-modal medical and brain data visualization tool.
  long_description: " OpenWalnut is a tool for multi-modal medical and brain data\
    \ visualization. Its\n universality allows it to be easily extended and used in\
    \ a large variety of\n application cases. It is both, a tool for the scientific\
    \ user and a powerful\n framework for the visualization researcher. Besides others,\
    \ it is able to load\n NIfTI data, VTK line data and RIFF-format CNT/AVR-files.\
    \ OpenWalnut provides\n many standard visualization tools like line integral convolution\
    \ (LIC),\n isosurface-extraction, glyph-rendering or interactive fiber-data exploration.\n\
    \ The powerful framework of OpenWalnut allows researchers and power-users to\n\
    \ easily extend the functionality to their specific needs.\n .\n This package\
    \ contains the QT4 GUI for OpenWalnut.\n"
