    "description": "The complement component 1q (C1q) is a protein together with C1r and C1s form the C1 complex. C1q is a 460 kDa hexameric glycoprotein composed of 18 polypeptide chains (6A, 6B, and 6C). The A chain (223 residues), B chain (226 residues), and C chain (217 residues) each have a short (3-9 residues) N-terminal region (containing a half-cysteine residue involved in inter-chain disulfide bond formation), followed by a collagen-like sequence of approximately 81 residues and a C-terminal globular region (gClq domain) of approximately 13.5 residues.",
