    "description": "Virtual laboratory which aims at assisting modellers both to understand the internal mechanisms of biological systems and to forecast, in silico, their response to external stimuli, environmental condition alterations or structural changes. Its framework is based on a core module which enables to design and manage biological models, and an extensible set of plugins by which MP models can be generated, optimized, simulated and analysed.",

MP-GeneticSynth is a Java tool for discovering the logic and regulation mechanisms responsible for observed biological dynamics in terms of finite difference recurrent equations. The software makes use of: (i) metabolic P systems as a modeling framework, (ii) an evolutionary approach to discover flux regulation functions as linear combinations of given primitive functions, (iii) a suitable reformulation of the least squares method to estimate function parameters considering simultaneously all the reactions involved in complex dynamics. The tool is available as a plugin for the virtual laboratory MetaPlab. It has graphical and interactive interfaces for data preparation, a priori knowledge integration, and flux regulator analysis.",
