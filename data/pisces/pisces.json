                "title": "PISCES: Recent improvements to a PDB sequence culling server", 
                "abstract": "PISCES is a database server for producing lists of sequences from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) using a number of entry- and chain-specific criteria and mutual sequence identity. Our goal in culling the PDB is to provide the longest list possible of the highest resolution structures that fulfill the sequence identity and structural quality cut-offs. The new PISCES server uses a combination of PSI-BLAST and structure-based alignments to determine sequence identities. Structure alignment produces more complete alignments and therefore more accurate sequence identities than PSI-BLAST. PISCES now allows a user to cull the PDB by-entry in addition to the standard culling by individual chains. In this scenario, a list will contain only entries that do not have a chain that has a sequence identity to any chain in any other entry in the list over the sequence identity cut-off. PISCES also provides fully annotated sequences including gene name and species. The server allows a user to cull an input list of entries or chains, so that other criteria, such as function, can be used. Results from a search on the re-engineered RCSB's site for the PDB can be entered into the PISCES server by a single click, combining the powerful searching abilities of the PDB with PISCES's utilities for sequence culling. The server's data are updated weekly. The server is available at http://dunbrack.fccc.edu/pisces. Â© 2005 Oxford University Press.",
