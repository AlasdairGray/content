      "sc:description": "A Novel Software and Method for the Efficient Development of Polymorphic SSR Loci Based on Transcriptome Data.\n\nWelcome to GitHub—where millions of developers work together on software. Ready to get started? Let’s learn how this all works by building and publishing your first GitHub Pages website!.\n\nRight now, we’re in your first GitHub repository. A repository is like a folder or storage space for your project. Your project's repository contains all its files such as code, documentation, images, and more. It also tracks every change that you—or your collaborators—make to each file, so you can always go back to previous versions of your project if you make any mistakes.\n\nThis repository contains three important files: The HTML code for your first website on GitHub, the CSS stylesheet that decorates your website with colors and fonts, and the README file. It also contains an image folder, with one image file.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'SSR'",
