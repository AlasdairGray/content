Image-based guidelines can improve contour accuracy but are underused. We sought to develop a free, online, easily accessible contouring resource that allows users to scroll through cases with 3-dimensional images and access relevant evidence-based contouring information. MATERIALS AND METHODS:eContour (http: econtour.org) was developed using modern Web technologies, primarily HTML5, Python, and JavaScript, to display JPEGs generated from DICOM files from real patient cases. The viewer has standard tools for image manipulation as well as toggling of contours and overlayed images and radiation dose distributions.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Usage eContour', 'METHODS:eContour', 'Development', 'evidence-based contouring', 'contouring'",
