  "sc:description": "Assembly and annotation of the mitochondrial minicircle genome of a differentiation-competent strain of Trypanosoma brucei.\n\nKinetoplastids are protists defined by one of the most complex mitochondrial genomes in nature, the kinetoplast. In the sleeping sickness parasite Trypanosoma brucei, the kinetoplast is a chain mail-like network of two types of interlocked DNA molecules: a few dozen ∼23-kb maxicircles (homologs of the mitochondrial genome of other eukaryotes) and thousands of ∼1-kb minicircles. Maxicircles encode components of respiratory chain complexes and the mitoribosome. Several maxicircle-encoded mRNAs undergo extensive post-transcriptional RNA editing via addition and deletion of uridines.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/beast (BIO.ED.AC.UK).\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'minicircle', 'kinetoplast', 'maxicircles'",
