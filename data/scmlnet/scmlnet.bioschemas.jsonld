      "sc:description": "Inferring microenvironmental regulation of gene expression from single-cell RNA sequencing data using scMLnet with an application to COVID-19.\n\nscMLnet is an R package developed to construct inter-/intracellular multilayer singaling network based on single-cell RNA-seq expression data. scMLnet constructs the multilayer network by integrating intercellular pathways (ligand-receptor interactions) and intracellular subnetworks (receptor-TF pathways and TF-target gene interactions) based on cell-type specific gene expression, prior network information and statistical inference. scMLnet can also visualize the constructed inter-/intracellular signaling pathways between the central cell and neighboring cells. scMLnet is implemented using R (version 3.6.0) and Python (version 3.7).",
