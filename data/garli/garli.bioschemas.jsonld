  "sc:description": "GARLI (Genetic Algorithm for Rapid Likelihood Inference) is a program for inferring phylogenetic trees. Using an approach similar to a classical genetic algorithm, it rapidly searches the space of evolutionary trees and model parameters to find the solution maximizing the likelihood score. It implements nucleotide, amino acid and codon-based models of sequence evolution, and runs on all platforms.",
