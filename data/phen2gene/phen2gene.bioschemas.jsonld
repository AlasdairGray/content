It is distributed under the MIT License by Wang Genomics Lab. Additionally, we have provided a web server and an associated RESTful API service for running Phen2Gene. Finally, a mobile app for Phen2Gene and several other genetic diagnostic tools from our lab is being tested and will be available soon.",
