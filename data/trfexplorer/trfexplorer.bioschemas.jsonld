  "sc:description": "Identification of tRNA-derived ncRNAs in TCGA and NCI-60 panel cell lines and development of the public database tRFexplorer.\n\ntRFexplorer is a public database through which users may display the expression profile of tRNA-derived ncRNAs in every cell line of NCI-60. The system allows to perform correlation analyses of tRNA-derived ncRNAs expression with all omics data and compound activities available on CellMiner. This provides an important opportunity to investigate their potential biological roles in absence of direct experimental evidences",
