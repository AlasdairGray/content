Thousands of \u03a8 sites have been identified within different biological contexts thanks to the advancement in high-throughput sequencing technology; nevertheless, the transcriptome-wide distribution, biomolecular functions, regulatory mechanisms, and disease relevance of pseudouridylation are largely elusive. We report here a web server\u2014PIANO\u2014for pseudouridine site (\u03a8) identification and functional annotation. PIANO was built upon a high-accuracy predictor that takes advantage of both conventional sequence features and 42 additional genomic features. When tested on six independent datasets generated from four independent \u03a8-profiling technologies (\u03a8-seq, RBS-seq, Pseudo-seq, and CeU-seq) as benchmarks, PIANO achieved an average AUC of 0.955 and 0.838 under the full transcript and mature mRNA models, respectively, marking a substantial improvement in accuracy compared to the existing in silico \u03a8-site prediction methods, i.e., PPUS (0.713 and 0.707), iRNA-PseU (0.713 and 0.712), and PseUI (0.634 and 0.652). Besides, PIANO web server systematically annotates the predicted \u03a8 sites with post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms (miRNA-targets, RBP-binding regions, and splicing sites) in its prediction report to help the users explore potential machinery of \u03a8. Moreover, a concise query interface was also built for 4,303 known \u03a8 sites, which is currently the largest collection of experimentally validated human \u03a8 sites.
