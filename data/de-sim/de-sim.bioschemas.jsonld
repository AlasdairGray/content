      "sc:description": "DE-Sim is an open-source, Python-based object-oriented discrete-event simulation (DES) tool that makes it easy to use large, heterogeneous datasets and high-level data science tools such as NumPy, pandas, SciPy, and SQLAlchemy to build and simulate complex computational models. Similar to Simula, DE-Sim models are implemented by defining logical process objects which read the values of a set of shared variables and schedule events to modify their values at discrete instants in time.",
