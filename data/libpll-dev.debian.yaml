  description: Phylogenetic Likelihood Library (development)
  long_description: " PLL is a highly optimized, parallelized software library to\
    \ ease the\n development of new software tools dealing with phylogenetic inference.\n\
    \ .\n Among the functions included in PLL are parsing multiple sequence\n alignments\
    \ (MSA) from PHYLIP and FASTA files, reading Newick trees,\n performing topological\
    \ moves such as SPR and NNI, model optimization,\n likelihood evaluation and partitioned\
    \ analysis by assigning different\n substitution models to each partition of the\
    \ MSA. PLL fully implements\n the GTR nucleotide substitution model for DNA data\
    \ and a number of\n models for aminoacid data.\n .\n This package contains the\
    \ static library and the header file.\n"
