      "sc:description": "a comprehensive database of drug combinations toward the discovery of combinatorial therapy.\n\nDrug combinations have demonstrated high efficacy and low adverse side effects compared to single drug administration in cancer therapies and thus have drawn intensive attention from researchers and pharmaceutical enterprises. Due to the rapid development of high-throughput screening (HTS), the number of drug combination datasets available has increased tremendously in recent years. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive database that is crucial to both experimental and computational screening of synergistic drug combinations.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/PredPRBA (DENGLAB.ORG), bio.tools/predrbr (DENGLAB.ORG), bio.tools/deepsacon (DENGLAB.ORG), bio.tools/predhs (DENGLAB.ORG)",
