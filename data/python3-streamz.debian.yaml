  description: build pipelines to manage continuous streams of data
  long_description: " It is simple to use in simple cases, but also supports complex\
    \ pipelines that\n involve branching, joining, flow control, feedback, back pressure,\
    \ and so on.\n Optionally, Streamz can also work with both Pandas and cuDF dataframes,\n\
    \ to provide sensible streaming operations on continuous tabular data.\n"
