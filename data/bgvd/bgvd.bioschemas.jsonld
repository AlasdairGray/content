      "sc:description": "Integrated Web-database for Bovine Sequencing Variations and Selective Signatures.\n\nAbstract Next-generation sequencing has yielded a vast amount of cattle genomic data for the global characterization of population genetic diversity and the identification of regions of the genome under natural and artificial selection. However, efficient storage, querying and visualization of such large datasets remain challenging. Here, we developed a comprehensive Bovine Genome Variation Database (BGVD, http: animal.nwsuaf.edu.cn BosVar ) that provides six main functionalities: Gene Search, Variation Search, Genomic Signature Search, Genome Browser, Alignment Search Tools and the Genome Coordinate Conversion Tool. The BGVD contains information on genomic variations comprising ∼60.44 M SNPs, ∼6.86 M indels, 76,634 CNV regions and signatures of selective sweeps in 432 samples from modern cattle worldwide.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
