  "sc:description": "Robust Moiety Model Selection Using Mass Spectrometry Measured Isotopologues.\n\nAbstract Stable isotope resolved metabolomics (SIRM) experiments uses stable isotope tracers to provide superior mass spectroscopy (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics datasets for metabolic flux analysis and metabolic modeling. Several software packages exist for metabolic flux analysis when provided a metabolic model and appropriate isotopomer and or isotopologue datasets, mostly from 13 C tracer time series experiments. However, assumptions of model correctness can seriously compromise interpretation of metabolic flux results generated from these packages. Therefore, we have developed a metabolic modeling software package specifically designed for moiety model comparison and selection based on the metabolomics data provided.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'moiety_modeling', 'metabolic' (bio.tools/metabolic), 'modeling', 'moiety'",
