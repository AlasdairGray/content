Therefore post-translational proteolytic processing of polyproteins into mature peptides (MPs) has been performed in silico, with a new computational method, for over 200 species in 5 pathogenic virus families (Caliciviridae, Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, Picornaviridae and Togaviridae). Results: Using pairwise alignment with reference sequences, MPs have been annotated and their sequences made available for search, analysis and download. At publication the method had produced 156 216 sequences, a large portion of the protein sequences now available in https://www.viprbrc.org. It represents a new and comprehensive mature peptide collection.",
