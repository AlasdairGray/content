Data were obtained from ab initio geometry optimization and frequency calculations at HF, B3LYP, MP2 and CCSD levels of theory on 6-311++G(d,p) basis set. In total, 1504 structures of halobenzenes, three structures of xylenes and one structure< div><div>of benzene were generated and processed by custom-made codes in Mathematica. The quantum chemical calculation was completed in Q-Chem software package. Geometric and energetic data of the compounds are presented in this paper as supplementary tables. Raw output files as well as codes and scripts associated with production and extraction of data are also provided.< div>.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'halobenzenes', 'xylenes', 'Q-Chem', 'Halobenzenes Xylenes divThis'",
