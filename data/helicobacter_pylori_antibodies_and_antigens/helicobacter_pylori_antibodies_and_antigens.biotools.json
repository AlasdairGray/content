    "description": "Helicobacter pylori is a gram-negative bacterium involved in the pathogenesis of peptic ulcer disease, gastric carcinoma, and lymphoma. The ecological niche of H. pylori is the human stomach, where the organism establishes long-term colonisation of the gastric mucosa. H. pylori causes chronic inflammation (gastritis) by invading the lining of the stomach and producing a cytotoxin termed vacuolating cytotoxin A (Vac-A), and thus can lead to ulcer formation.",
