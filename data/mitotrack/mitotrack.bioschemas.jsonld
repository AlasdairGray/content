  "sc:description": "user-friendly semi-automatic software for lineage tracking in living embryos.\n\nMOTIVATION:During development, progenitor cells undergo multiple rounds of cellular divisions during which transcriptional programs must be faithfully propagated. Investigating the timing of transcriptional activation, which is a highly stochastic phenomenon, requires the analysis of large amounts of data. In order to perform automatic image analysis of transcriptional activation, we developed a software that segments and tracks both small and large objects, leading the user from raw data up to the results in their final form. RESULTS:MitoTrack is a user-friendly open-access integrated software that performs the specific dual task of reporting the precise timing of transcriptional activation while keeping lineage tree history for each nucleus of a living developing embryo.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'AVAILABILITY:MitoTrack', 'RESULTS:MitoTrack'",
