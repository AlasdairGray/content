    "description": "VarCoPP predicts the potential pathogenicity of variant combinations in gene pairs. It is based on digenic data present in DIDA and it was trained against variants from the 1000 Genomes Project. VarCoPP consists of an ensemble of 500 individual Random Forest predictors. \nA variant combination can be either predicted as disease-causing (i.e. candidate or probably pathogenic) or neutral (i.e. probably neutral). \n\nVarCoPP can be applied for Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) and small insertions/deletions from a single individual using the genome version GRCh37/hg19. It is highly recommended to perform beforehand an initial variant filtering procedure and generally restrict the analysis to variants from up to 150 genes. \n\nFor more information about the method and its usage, you can consult our About page. VarCoPP was developed in the Interuniversity Institute of Bioinformatics in Brussels, under the collaboration of Université libre de Bruxelles and Vrije Universiteit Brussel.",

All rights reserved.Notwithstanding important advances in the context of single-variant pathogenicity identification, novel breakthroughs in discerning the origins of many rare diseases require methods able to identify more complex genetic models. We present here the Variant Combinations Pathogenicity Predictor (VarCoPP), a machine-learning approach that identifies pathogenic variant combinations in gene pairs (called digenic or bilocus variant combinations). We show that the results produced by this method are highly accurate and precise, an efficacy that is endorsed when validating the method on recently published independent disease-causing data. Confidence labels of 95% and 99% are identified, representing the probability of a bilocus combination being a true pathogenic result, providing geneticists with rational markers to evaluate the most relevant pathogenic combinations and limit the search space and time. Finally, the VarCoPP has been designed to act as an interpretable method that can provide explanations on why a bilocus combination is predicted as pathogenic and which biological information is important for that prediction. This work provides an important step toward the genetic understanding of rare diseases, paving the way to clinical knowledge and improved patient care.",
