  "sc:description": "Targeted RNA-sequencing selects and sequences subset transcripts of interests, increasing the coverage of a focused set of RNA sequences. It is an accurate method that generates genomic and gene-expression information of specific genome regions. The specific RNA sequences analysis enables RNA-Seq with high sensitivity and cost-effective access to NGS. By either targeted capture enrichment or amplicon-based approaches, Targeted RNA-Seq measures dozens to thousands of targets simultaneously. Enrichment assays also is a tool to identify both known and novel gene fusion partners in many sample types.",
