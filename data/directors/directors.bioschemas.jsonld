      "sc:description": "Plastic Surgery Training and the Problematic Resident.\n\nINTRODUCTION:Plastic surgery resident education is a significant commitment by both programs and residents. Unfortunately, problematic resident behavior may occur and be difficult to manage. This study was designed to survey plastic surgery program directors to elucidate their experience with problematic resident behavior. METHODS:A electronic survey was prepared using the online platform, qualtrics. The survey was distributed by email to all plastic surgery program directors. Questions were designed to evaluate frequency of problematic behavior and methods to manage the behaviors. A reminder was sent 3 weeks after initial distribution. Responses were collected for an additional 3 weeks. Responses were pooled separately for integrated and independent program directors. RESULTS:Thirty-eight program directors responded including 10 independent and 28 integrated program directors.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
