    "description": "Ferredoxin reductase is a ubiquitous flavoenzyme, containing noncovalently bound FAD as a prosthetic group. It plays a role in delivering NADPH or low potential one-electron donors such as ferredoxin and flavodoxin to redox-based metabolisms in plastids, mitochondria and bacteria. In mammals, ferredoxin reductase is loosely associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane and receives electrons from NADPH.",
