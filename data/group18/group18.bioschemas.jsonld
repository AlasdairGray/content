      "sc:description": "Massive in Silico Study of Noble Gas Binding to the Structural Proteome.\n\nNoble gases are chemically inert, and it was therefore thought they would have little effect on biology. Paradoxically, it was found that they do exhibit a wide range of biological effects, many of which are target-specific and potentially useful and some of which have been demonstrated in vivo. The underlying mechanisms by which useful pharmacology, such as tissue and neuroprotection, anti-addiction effects, and analgesia, is elicited are relatively unexplored. Experiments to probe the interactions of noble gases with specific proteins are more difficult with gases than those with other chemicals.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/harman (CSIRO.AU), bio.tools/tilehmm (CSIRO.AU), bio.tools/k-link (CSIRO.AU), bio.tools/blue (CSIRO.AU).\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'noble gases', 'gases', 'noble', 'gas-protein'",
