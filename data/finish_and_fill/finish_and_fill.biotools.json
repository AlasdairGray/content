    "description": "As the final stage of industrial enzyme production, the manufactured product should be carefully tested for quality and performance. In addition, the formulation step is essential to maintain enzyme activity in harsh environments. At Creative Enzymes, the Quality Control (QC) will examine enzyme properties including appearance, potency, purity, and sterility. We also apply strict Quality Assurance (QA) procedures to guarantee batch-to-batch stability. These steps build the complete finishing process and are available to customers.",
