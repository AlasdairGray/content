  "sc:description": "heuristic-free alignment for assessing linear and graph read aligners.\n\nVargas computes optimal alignments of short reads to a directed acyclic graph (DAG). After building a graph, reads are aligned using a SIMD-vectorized version of the Smith-Waterman dynamic programming algorithm, with 16 -- 64 reads per vector depending on the instruction set",
