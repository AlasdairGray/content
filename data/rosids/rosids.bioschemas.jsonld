(2019) | Here you will find all the code used in the analyses of Gonçalves et al. 2019 and the tutorials presented in Gonçalves et al. in review | In this first pipeline, we present the code used to processes Illumina reads using bbtools software to remove adaptors, phix, quality trim and to assemble reads into contigs | Here we aligned genes from the plastid genome using two software, MAFFT and MACSE. Then the alignments were used as input in a series of phylogenetic analyses using Maximum Likelihood and Multispecies Coalescent methods",
