  long_description: " MacroMoleculeBuilder, previously known as RNABuilder, can be\
    \ used for morphing,\n homology modeling, folding (e.g. using base pairing contacts),\
    \ redesigning\n complexes, fitting to low-resolution density maps, predicting\
    \ local\n rearrangements upon mutation, and many other applications.\n .\n This\
    \ package contains the development files.\n"
