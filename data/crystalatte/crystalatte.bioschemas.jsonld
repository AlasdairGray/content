  "sc:description": "Automated computation of lattice energies of organic crystals exploiting the many-body expansion to achieve dual-level parallelism.\n\nSet of scripts to automate the calculation of crystal lattice energies.\n\nAutomated calculation of crystal lattice energies with the many-body expansion.\n\nCrystaLattE has an interface with the quantum chemistry package PSI4. To run, the code requires a crystallographic information file containing structural information of the crystal and an input file specifying execution details. Work continues in the creation of a CrystaLattE pip package. So, for the moment, the instructions to download and install CrystaLattE and to create a conda environment that includes PSI4 are presented below.\n\nCyrstaLattE is a software that automates the computation of crystal lattice energies using the many-body cluster expansion",
