      "sc:description": "Clinical application of Web Accessible Population Pharmacokinetic Service-Hemophilia (WAPPS-Hemo).\n\nBACKGROUND:Use of population pharmacokinetics (PopPK) to facilitate PK-informed prophylaxis in clinical practice has gained momentum among haemophilia providers due to the accessibility of tools such as the Web Accessible Population Pharmacokinetic Service-Hemophilia (WAPPS-Hemo) and availability of extended half-life (EHL) factor concentrates. It is unknown how clinicians implement PopPK. AIM:To investigate the evolution of PopPK use in clinical practice by comparing blood sampling strategies, patient features, and factor group between initial and recent periods of WAPPS-Hemo availability. METHODS:PK data for haemophilia A and haemophilia B patients from two time periods were extracted from the WAPPS-Hemo database: early availability (10 2015-09 2016) and recent use (10 2017-09 2018).\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
