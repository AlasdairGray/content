  "sc:description": "In the past decades, large-scale endeavors provide a preliminary understanding of the biology and medical significance of human microbiota. DNA-based analyses, especially next-generation sequencing, have expanded our horizon by generating enormous new data sets that can be mined for information on the composition and functional properties of microbial communities. With extensive experience in human microbiome research, we can provide a comprehensive solution to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academia and government agencies.",
