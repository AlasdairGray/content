    "description": "Enzyme formulation is an important process step besides production and purification. Although much effort has been focused on discovering the right enzyme for a given application, enzyme formulation also plays a pivotal role in the final use and success of the enzyme product. Therefore, Creative Enzymes has developed advanced enzyme formulations to help with commercialization of as many enzyme products as possible.",
