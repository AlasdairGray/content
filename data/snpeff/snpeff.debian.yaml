  description: genetic variant annotation and effect prediction toolbox
  long_description: " SnpEff is a variant annotation and effect prediction tool. It\
    \ annotates\n and predicts the effects of variants on genes (such as amino acid\n\
    \ changes).\n .\n The inputs are predicted variants (SNPs, insertions, deletions\
    \ and\n MNPs). The input file is usually obtained as a result of a sequencing\n\
    \ experiment, and it is usually in variant call format (VCF).\n .\n SnpEff analyzes\
    \ the input variants. It annotates the variants and\n calculates the effects they\
    \ produce on known genes (e.g. amino acid\n changes). A list of effects and annotations\
    \ that SnpEff can calculate\n can be found here."
