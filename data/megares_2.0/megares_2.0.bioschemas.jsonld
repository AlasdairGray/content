  "sc:description": "a database for classification of antimicrobial drug, biocide and metal resistance determinants in metagenomic sequence data.\n\nMEGAResFrom MEG, the Microbial Ecology Group.\n\nWelcome to MEGARes: an Antimicrobial Database for High-Throughput Sequencing.\n\nThe MEGARes database contains sequence data for approximately 8,000 hand-curated antimicrobial resistance genes accompanied by an annotation structure that is optimized for use with high throughput sequencing. The acyclical annotation graph of MEGARes allows for accurate, count-based, hierarchical statistical analysis of resistance at the population level, much like microbiome analysis, and is also designed to be used as a training database for the creation of statistical classifiers (Figure 1).\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'MEGARes'",
