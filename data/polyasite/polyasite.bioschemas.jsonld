  "sc:description": "a consolidated atlas of polyadenylation sites from 3' end sequencing.\n\nA portal to the curated set of poly(A) sites that we inferred in the human, mouse and worm genomes, based on all 3â€™ end sequencing datasets that we could identify in the SRA nucleotide database as of June 2019.\n\nLearn more about the techniques used for 3' end sequencing.\n\nSamples contributing to our atlases.\n\nGet details on any sample we used for building our atlases. You can also filter, either by organism or by protocol, or just try a search term.\n\nSearch for poly(A) sites in your gene/genomic region of interest.\n\nIn the 2P-Seq protocol, reverse transcription is accomplished by an anchored oligo(dT) primer.\n\nThe Atlas - our curated dataset of poly(A) sites - can be downloaded or explored in the UCSC genome browser.\n\nIf you use PolyASite in your work, please cite:.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'PolyASite 2.0'",
