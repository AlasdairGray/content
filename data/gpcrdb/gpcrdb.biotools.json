The GPCR database, GPCRdb, serves a dual role in disseminating and enabling new scientific developments by providing reference data, analysis tools and interactive diagrams. This paper highlights new features in the fifth major GPCRdb release: (i) GPCR crystal structure browsing, superposition and display of ligand interactions; (ii) direct deposition by users of point mutations and their effects on ligand binding; (iii) refined snake and helix box residue diagram looks; and (iii) phylogenetic trees with receptor classification colour schemes. Under the hood, the entire GPCRdb front- and back-ends have been recoded within one infrastructure, ensuring a smooth browsing experience and development. GPCRdb is available at http://www.gpcrdb.org/ and it's open source code at https://bitbucket.org/gpcr/protwis.",

The GPCR database, GPCRdb serves >4 000 researchers every month and offers reference data, analysis of own or literature data, experiment design and dissemination of published datasets. Here, we describe new and updated GPCRdb resources with a particular focus on integration of sequence, structure and function. GPCRdb contains all human non-olfactory GPCRs (and >27 000 orthologs), G-proteins and arrestins. It includes over 2 000 drug and in-trial agents and nearly 200 000 ligands with activity and availability data. GPCRdb annotates all published GPCR structures (updated monthly), which are also offered in a refined version (with re-modeled missing/distorted regions and reverted mutations) and provides structure models of all human non-olfactory receptors in inactive, intermediate and active states. Mutagenesis data in the GPCRdb spans natural genetic variants, GPCR-G protein interfaces, ligand sites and thermostabilising mutations. A new sequence signature tool for identification of functional residue determinants has been added and two data driven tools to design ligand site mutations and constructs for structure determination have been updated extending their coverage of receptors and modifications. The GPCRdb is available at https://gpcrdb.org.",

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.G protein-coupled receptors are the most abundant mediators of both human signalling processes and therapeutic effects. Herein, we report GPCRome-wide homology models of unprecedented quality, and roughly 150 000 GPCR ligands with data on biological activities and commercial availability. Based on the strategy of 'Less model - more Xtal', each model exploits both a main template and alternative local templates. This achieved higher similarity to new structures than any of the existing resources, and refined crystal structures with missing or distorted regions. Models are provided for inactive, intermediate and active states - except for classes C and F that so far only have inactive templates. The ligand database has separate browsers for: (i) target selection by receptor, family or class, (ii) ligand filtering based on cross-experiment activities (min, max and mean) or chemical properties, (iii) ligand source data and (iv) commercial availability. SMILES structures and activity spreadsheets can be downloaded for further processing. Furthermore, three recent landmark publications on GPCR drugs, G protein selectivity and genetic variants have been accompanied with resources that now let readers view and analyse the findings themselves in GPCRdb. Altogether, this update will enable scientific investigation for the wider GPCR community. GPCRdb is available at http://www.gpcrdb.org.",

GPCR-mediated signalling can differ because of changes in the sequence1,2 or expression3 of the receptors, leading to signalling bias when comparing diverse physiological systems4. An underexplored source of such bias is the generation of functionally diverse GPCR isoforms with different patterns of expression across different tissues. Here we integrate data from human tissue-level transcriptomes, GPCR sequences and structures, proteomics, single-cell transcriptomics, population-wide genetic association studies and pharmacological experiments. We show how a single GPCR gene can diversify into several isoforms with distinct signalling properties, and how unique isoform combinations expressed in different tissues can generate distinct signalling states. Depending on their structural changes and expression patterns, some of the detected isoforms may influence cellular responses to drugs and represent new targets for developing drugs with improved tissue selectivity. Our findings highlight the need to move from a canonical to a context-specific view of GPCR signalling that considers how combinatorial expression of isoforms in a particular cell type, tissue or organism collectively influences receptor signalling and drug responses.",
