                "abstract": "In this study, an attempt has been made to develop a method for predicting weak hydrogen bonding interactions, namely, Cα-H⋯O and Cα-H⋯π interactions in proteins using artificial neural network. Both standard feed-forward neural network (FNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) have been trained and tested using five-fold cross-validation on a non-homologous dataset of 2298 protein chains where no pair of sequences has more than 25% sequence identity. It has been found that the prediction accuracy varies with the separation distance between donor and acceptor residues. The maximum sensitivity achieved with RNN for Cα-H⋯O is 51.2% when donor and acceptor residues are four residues apart (i.e. at ΔD-A=4) and for Cα-H⋯π is 82.1% at ΔD-A=3. The performance of RNN is increased by 1-3% for both types of interactions when PSIPRED predicted protein secondary structure is used. Overall, RNN performs better than feed-forward networks at all separation distances between donor-acceptor pair for both types of interactions. Based on the observations, a web server CHpredict (available at http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/chpredict/) has been developed for predicting donor and acceptor residues in Cα-H⋯O and Cα-H⋯π interactions in proteins. © 2006 IOS Press.
