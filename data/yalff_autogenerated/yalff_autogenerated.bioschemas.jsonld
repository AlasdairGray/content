  "sc:description": "Indexing k-mers in linear space for quality value compression.\n\nYALFF (Yet Another Lossy FASTQ Filter) is a smoother for FASTQ files which uses an FM-Index to store the k-mer database. The compressed index greatly reduces the amount of memory required compared to other tools such as QUARTZ. This is because the dictionary of k-mers can be linearized into contigs.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'memory-inefficient', 'compressibility', 'dictionaries', 'worsened'",
