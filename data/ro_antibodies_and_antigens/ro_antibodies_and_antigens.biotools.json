    "description": "These autoantigens are referred to as \"Ro52\" and \"Ro60,\" respectively. The two autoantigens were originally thought to interact with each other, but subsequent studies have shown that the two proteins reside in distinct cellular compartments, with Ro60 localized to the nucleus and nucleolus and with Ro52 localized to the cytoplasm.",
