    "description": "CD Magnetic Buccal Swab/Saliva DNA Kit is specially designed for genomic DNA isolation from buccal swab, saliva, mouthwash and other buccal sample types fast and high-throughput. Based on magnetic-particle technology and specific buffer solution, DNA binds to the silica surface of the magnetic particles free from proteins and other contaminants. The kit is suitable for DNA purification by manual operation or automated extraction system. The purified DNA can be used directly for molecular biological experiments such as restriction analysis, PCR analysis, Southern Blot and library construction.",
