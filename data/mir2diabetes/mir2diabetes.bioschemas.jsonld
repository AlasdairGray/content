  "sc:description": "A Literature-Curated Database of microRNA Expression Patterns, in Diabetic Microvascular Complications.\n\nmicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been established as critical regulators of the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus (DM), and diabetes microvascular complications (DMCs). However, manually curated databases for miRNAs, and DM (including DMCs) association studies, have yet to be established. Here, we constructed a user-friendly database, \"miR2Diabetes,\" equipped with a graphical web interface for simple browsing or searching manually curated annotations. The annotations in our database cover 14 DM and DMC phenotypes, involving 156 miRNAs, by browsing diverse sample origins (e.g., blood, kidney, liver, and other tissues).\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'DMCs', 'DM DMCs'",
