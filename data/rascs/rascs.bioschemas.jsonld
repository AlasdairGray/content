      "sc:description": "Retrieval of Absorption or Scattering Coefficient Spectrum (RASCS) Program.\n\nBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:Optical properties characterize light propagation in turbid media, such as tissue. Recovery of optical properties is of great importance in a wide variety of biomedical applications, including both therapeutic treatments and diagnosis. Most of the available methodologies are well established, however, these are not optimized for real-time measurements. STUDY DESIGN MATERIALS AND METHODS:Optical properties are recovered using the Inverse Adding Doubling program from reflectance measurements measured with an integrating sphere and light in the visible range. A user-friendly interface was programmed in Visual Studio and the libraries of a particular spectrophotometer were used.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Retrieval Absorption Scattering Coefficient Spectrum Program', 'optical', 'OBJECTIVES:Optical', 'METHODS:Optical'",
