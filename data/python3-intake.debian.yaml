  description: lightweight package for finding and investigating data
  long_description: " Intake is a lightweight set of tools for loading and sharing\
    \ data in\n data science projects. Intake helps you:\n .\n  1. Load data from\
    \ a variety of formats into containers you already know,\n     like Pandas dataframes,\
    \ Python lists, NumPy arrays and more.\n  2. Convert boilerplate data loading\
    \ code into reusable intake plugins.\n  3. Describe data sets in catalog files\
    \ for easy reuse and sharing\n     between projects and with others.\n  4. Share\
    \ catalog information (and data sets) over the network with the\n     Intake server.\n"
