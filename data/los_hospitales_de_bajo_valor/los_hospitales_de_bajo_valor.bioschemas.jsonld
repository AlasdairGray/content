  "sc:description": "Preventing Complications or Improving Efficiency.\n\nBACKGROUND:There is increased focus on the value of surgical care. Postoperative complications decrease value, but it is unknown whether high-value hospitals spend less than low-value hospitals in cases without complications. Previous studies have not evaluated both expenditures and validated outcomes in the same patients, limiting the understanding of interactions between clinical performance, efficient utilization of services, and costliness of surgical episodes. OBJECTIVE:This study aimed to identify payment differences between low- and high-value hospitals in colectomy cases without adverse outcomes using a linked data set of multipayer claims and validated clinical outcomes. DESIGN:This is a retrospective observational cohort study.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'los hospitales de alto valor', 'hospitales de bajo valor', 'bajo valor con casos sin', 'valor con casos sin resultados'",
