    "description": "Peptides are short linear strings of amino acids that control many functions in the human body, normally not organized in a stable three-dimensional structure, at least before their binding to targets. The length limit between a peptide and a protein is arbitrarily fixed as 50 amino acids and molecular weight below 10 kDa.",
