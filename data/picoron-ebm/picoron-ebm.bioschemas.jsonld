      "sc:description": "PICO and Risk Of bias Navigator for Evidence Based Medicine.\n\nEvidence-based medicine (EBM) involves determining treatment that matches the needs of each patient by integrating the best and latest available “scientific evidence” and “clinical skills”. Systematic review and meta-analysis refer to the process of searching databases and performing statistical analysis to integrate the results of multiple independent studies conducted in the past. The results obtained provide the highest quality evidence, which has become the foundation of various clinical guidelines. Systematic review and meta-analysis are conducted in the following sequence: 1) formulation of a hypothesis, 2) searching databases for articles, 3) selection of research articles, 4) evaluation of bias for each study, 5) integration of the results, 6) verification of bias, and 7) evaluation of the quality of the meta-analysis",
