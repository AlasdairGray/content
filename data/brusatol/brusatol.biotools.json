    "description": "Brusatol is a quassinoid isolated from the Brucea javanica plant that has recently been shown to inhibit Nrf2 signaling, reduce tumor burden, and ameliorate chemoresistance in both in vitro and in vivo cancer models. Brusatol also inhibits c-Myc expression and showed that overexpression of c-Myc prevented brusatol-induced degradation of HIF-1\u03b1 and cancer cell death by increasing mitochondrial ROS production and subsequent ROS-mediated transition of ferrous iron to ferric iron.",
