  "sc:description": "Prediction of Homolytic Bond Dissociation Enthalpies for Organic Molecules at near Chemical Accuracy with Sub-Second Computational Cost.\n\nA machine- L earning derived, F ast, A ccurate B ond dissociation E nthalpy T ool.\n\nMachine learning predictions of bond dissociation energies (BDEs).\n\nThis tool predicts BDEs for single, noncyclic bonds in neutral organic molecules consisting of C, H, O, and N atoms. Mean absolute errors are typically less than 1 kcal/mol for most compounds. To use, enter a SMILES string above (or use the drawing tool) and press submit. Reference DFT-calculated BDEs used as training can be displayed for any predicted bond using the neighbors link.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'ALFABET', 'Bond Dissociation Enthalpies', 'Bond dissociation Enthalpy'",
