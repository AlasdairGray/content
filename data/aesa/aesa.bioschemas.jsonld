  "sc:description": "Advancing Pan-cancer Gene Expression Survial Analysis by Inclusion of Non-coding RNA.\n\nNon-coding RNAs occupy a significant fraction of the human genome. Their biological significance is backed up by a plethora of emerging evidence. One of the most robust approaches to demonstrate non-coding RNA's biological relevance is through their prognostic value. Using the rich gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Altas (TCGA), we designed Advanced Expression Survival Analysis (AESA), a web tool which provides several novel survival analysis approaches not offered by previous tools. In addition to the common single-gene approach, AESA computes the gene expression composite score of a set of genes for survival analysis and utilizes permutation test or cross-validation to assess the significance of log-rank statistic and the degree of over-fitting.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
