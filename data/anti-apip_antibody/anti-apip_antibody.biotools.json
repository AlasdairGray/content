    "description": "APIP is an APAF1 (MIM 602233)-an interacting protein that acts as a negative regulator of ischemic/hypoxic injury. Exogenous APIP inhibits cytochrome c-induced activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 and suppresses cell death triggered by mitochondrial apoptotic stimuli through inhibiting the downstream activity of cytochrome c released from mitochondria.",
