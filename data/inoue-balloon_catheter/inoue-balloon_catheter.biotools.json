    "description": "The Inoue-balloon Catheter composed of polyvinyl chloride has a balloon attached to the distal end. The balloon is two latex layers with a polyester micromesh between them. The catheter is 12F in diameter and 70 cm in length. The length of each balloon is 2.5 cm (unstretched). Two proximally located stopcocks complete inflation of the balloon and exhaust of the catheter. Prior to insertion, the balloon was stretched and refined using a stainless steel tube, and the atrium opening was enlarged using a 14F conical dilator. Stainless steel probes and wires are used to guide catheters inside the heart and blood vessels. The balloon was manually inflated using a syringe and the diameter of the balloon was measured with a caliper (ruler).",
