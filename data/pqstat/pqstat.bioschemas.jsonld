The basic statistics have been enriched with the newest algorithms that have enabled using so called exact solutions. This way, we have added the exact equivalents of the statistical tests based in the asymptotic distributions (large frequency distribution).\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'PQScut', 'Searching space-time clusters', 'CutL', 'Kulldorff'",
