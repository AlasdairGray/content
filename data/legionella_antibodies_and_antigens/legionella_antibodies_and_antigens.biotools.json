    "description": "Legionella is a genus of pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria that includes the species L. pneumophila. Legionella bacteria can cause a serious type of pneumonia (lung infection) called Legionnaires\u2019 disease. The bacteria can also cause a less serious illness called Pontiac fever. The genus Legionella currently has over 50 species comprising 70 distinct serogroups. One species of Legionella, L. pneumophila, is the main cause (90%) of Legionellosis, and 70-80% of those cases are attributed to infection with serogroup type I.",
