A pilot project began in 2014 that is now supported by the Utah Division of Air Quality to observe and visualize pollutant concentrations continuously on light rail cars on all three TRAX lines (Red, Green, and Blue). From the data collected, we are able to detect distinct spatial patterns and temporal variations year-round.\n\nEXAMPLE CASES outside nowDATA ACCESS/DOWNLOADPUBLICATIONS & NEWS.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'TRAX Observation', 'TRAX Light-Rail Train Air Quality', 'TRAX Light-Rail', 'TRAX Light-Rail Train Air'",
