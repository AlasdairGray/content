      "sc:description": "Computational Modeling Reveals Frequency Modulation of Calcium-cAMP/PKA Pathway in Dendritic Spines.\n\nDendritic spines are the primary excitatory postsynaptic sites that act as subcompartments of signaling. Ca2+ is often the first and most rapid signal in spines. Downstream of calcium, the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) protein kinase A (PKA) pathway plays a critical role in the regulation of spine formation, morphological modifications, and ultimately, learning and memory. Although the dynamics of calcium are reasonably well-studied, calcium-induced cAMP PKA dynamics, particularly with respect to frequency modulation, are not fully explored. In this study, we present a well-mixed model for the dynamics of calcium-induced cAMP PKA dynamics in dendritic spines. The model is constrained using experimental observations in the literature.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'dendritic spines', 'spines', 'well-mixed', 'calcium-induced'",
