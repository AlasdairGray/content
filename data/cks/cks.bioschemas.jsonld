Despite a growing evidence base on effective interventions for treatment engagement, attempts to address these challenges rarely leverage the available relevant research. To close this gap, this pilot study examined the feasibility, acceptability, and initial implementation outcomes of a coordinated knowledge system (CKS) designed to support the efforts of school mental health (SMH) professionals to address treatment engagement challenges.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
