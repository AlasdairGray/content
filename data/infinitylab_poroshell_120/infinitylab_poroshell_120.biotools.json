    "description": "InfinityLab Poroshell 120 is suitable for reversed-phase liquid chromatography separation provide excellent efficiency and reliability. Eleven chemically bonded phases (from C18 columns to unique chemically bonded phases) have up to three particle sizes: 1.9 \u00b5m, 2.7 \u00b5m, and 4 \u00b5m. This series of chemically bonded phases provides a wide range of selectivity for scalable liquid chromatography method development, from traditional HPLC to UHPLC to ultra-low diffusion UHPLC.",
