  "sc:description": "A probabilistic model to recover individual genomes from metagenomes.\n\nMGLEX - MetaGenome Likelihood EXtractor.\n\nThis Python Package provides a probabilistic model to classify nucleotide sequences in metagenome samples. It was developed as a framework to help researchers to reconstruct individual genomes from such datasets using custom workflows and to give developers the possibility to integrate the model into their programs.\n\nMGLEX â€“ A Python Package for Probabilistic Modeling and Binning of Metagenomes.\n\nWe recommend to create a Python virtual installation enviroment for MGLEX. In order to do so, install the venv package for your Python version (e.g. the Debian package python3.4-venv), if not included (or use virtualenv). The following command will make use of the installed system packages",
