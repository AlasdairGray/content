    "description": "Metabolic flux analysis (MFA) has been a pillar of pathway engineering since the inception of biocatalysis development. In pathway engineering, once the designed pathway is introduced in the host strain, the metabolic fluxes need to be re-apportioned towards the target product. In the past three decades, various flux analysis techniques have been developed and applied to elucidate intracellular metabolism in a wide range of biological systems, ranging from simple microbes to complex eukaryotic systems.",
