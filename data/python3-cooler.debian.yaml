  description: library for a sparse, compressed, binary persistent storage
  long_description: " Cooler is a support library for a sparse, compressed, binary\
    \ persistent\n storage format, also called cooler, used to store genomic interaction\n\
    \ data, such as Hi-C contact matrices.\n .\n The cooler file format is an implementation\
