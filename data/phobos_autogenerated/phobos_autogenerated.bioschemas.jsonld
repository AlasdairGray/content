      "sc:description": "A Freely Available, Self-Calibrating Software for Automatic Measurement of Freezing Behavior.\n\nPhobos - Version 1.0 â€“ May 21, 2019.\n\nDistributed by Felippe E. Amorim, Thiago C. Moulin and Olavo B. Amaral.\n\nPhobos is a software for the automated analysis of freezing behavior in rodents. Unlike other programs, it uses manual quantification of a short video to calibrate parameters for optimal freezing detection. Phobos works with 3 user interfaces (UIs) for this purpose. The main user UI is where the user loads videos for quantification, defines an output folder and creates the .xls file with the results. The Video Parameters UI is where the user defines the beginning and end times for freezing detection in the videos and crops the image to restrict the analysis to a specific area. Finally, the Manual Quantification UI is used to manually quantify freezing in a video, which will then be used as a reference for the calibration process.\n\n||| NAME EQUAL TO (PUB.
