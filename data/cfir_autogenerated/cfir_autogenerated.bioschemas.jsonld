  "sc:description": "Exploring barriers and facilitators to integrated hypertension-HIV management in Ugandan HIV clinics using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR).\n\nBackground: Persons Living with HIV (PLHIV) receiving antiretroviral therapy have increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Integration of services for hypertension (HTN), the primary CVD risk factor, into HIV clinics is recommended in Uganda. Our prior work demonstrated multiple gaps in implementation of integrated HTN care along the HIV treatment cascade. In this study, we sought to explore barriers to, and facilitators of, integrating HTN screening and treatment into HIV clinics in Eastern Uganda. Methods: We conducted a qualitative study at three HIV clinics with low, intermediate, and high HTN care cascade performance, which we classified based on our prior work.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| NAME EQUAL TO (PUB. DIFFERENT) bio.tools/CFIR.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'HTN', 'HTN HIV'",
