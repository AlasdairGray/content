  "sc:description": "a unified gene expression atlas for the model plant Physcomitrella patens.\n\nPEATmoss is an interactive tool to visualize gene expression data. These help pages explain several ways to query the expression data and to visualize the results, enabling the comparison of the expression profiles of several genes simultaneously, as well as to visualize co-expression information. One section describes how to download the expression data in a format that is easy to export to spreadsheet software and to generate figures that are ready for presentations or publications.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'PEATmoss Physcomitrella Expression Atlas Tool'",
