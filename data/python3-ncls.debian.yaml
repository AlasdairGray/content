  description: datastructure for interval overlap queries
  long_description: " The Nested Containment List is a datastructure for interval\
    \ overlap\n queries, like the interval tree. It is usually an order of magnitude\n\
    \ faster than the interval tree both for building and query lookups.\n .\n The\
    \ implementation here is a revived version of the one used in the\n now defunct\
    \ PyGr library, which died of bitrot. It was now made less\n memory-consuming\
    \ and wrapper functions allow batch-querying\n the NCLS for further speed gains.\n\
    \ .\n This package was implemented to be the cornerstone of the PyRanges project,\n\
    \ but was made available to the Python community as a stand-alone library.\n"
