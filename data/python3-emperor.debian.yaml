  description: visualizing high-throughput microbial community data
  long_description: " Emperor is an interactive next generation tool for the analysis,\n\
    \ visualization and understanding of high throughput microbial\n ecology datasets.\n\
    \ .\n Due to its tailor-made graphical user interface, delving into a new\n dataset\
    \ to elucidate the patterns hidden in the data, has never been\n easier. Emperor\
    \ brings a rich set of customizations and modifications\n that can be integrated\
    \ into any QIIME or scikit-bio compliant dataset;\n with lightweight data files\
    \ and hardware accelerated graphics,\n constitutes itself as the state of the\
    \ art for analyzing N-dimensional\n data using principal coordinates analysis."
