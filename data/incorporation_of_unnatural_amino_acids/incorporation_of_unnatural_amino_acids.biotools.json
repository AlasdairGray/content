    "description": "The development of experimental techniques that allow incorporation of unnatural amino acids (uAAs) into proteins has opened new avenues in enzyme engineering, bringing modified enzymes into wide range of unnatural realm with new or improved activities and novel mechanistic probes. Creative Enzymes actively develops new uAAs, and the technique and skills to introduce uAAs into enzymes.",
