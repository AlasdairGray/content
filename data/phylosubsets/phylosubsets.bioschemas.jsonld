If larger subsets are required you can download full trees.\n\nThe tool first trims to a subset, and then samples trees from a chosen pseudo-posterior distribution. Note that any further analyses should only be conducted with a large sample of trees.\n\nSelect species from the list which follows the taxonomy. Then copy and paste or drag and drop them into the box to the right.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Inferring mammal tree'",
