  description: library to query large collection of NGS sequences (development)
  long_description: " Gk-arrays are provided as a simple-to-use C++ library dedicated\
    \ to\n queries on large collection of sequences as produced by high-throughput\n\
    \ sequencers (e.g. HiSeq 2000 from Illumina, 454 from Roche).\n .\n Gk-arrays\
    \ index k-mers of reads and allows one to answer different queries\n on that read\
    \ collection (e.g. how many reads share this k-mer? where does\n this k-mer occur\
    \ in the read collection?).\n .\n Gk-arrays consist of a space-efficient alternative\
    \ to hash tables while\n being similar in terms of query times.\n .\n This is\
    \ the development library for libgkarrays.\n"
