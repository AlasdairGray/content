All structures have been annotated with experimental conditions, structure identifiers, bibliographic references and types of tautomerism involved. The structures and experiment-related data were extracted from a total of 171 publications, including reviews reporting on multiple primary studies.\n\n2,819 Tautomeric Tuples Comprising 5,977 Structures.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'tautomeric entry', 'Tautomerism Analyses'",
