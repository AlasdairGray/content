      "sc:description": "Polymorphisms of MTHFR and TYMS predict capecitabine-induced hand-foot syndrome in patients with metastatic breast cancer.\n\nBACKGROUND:Breast cancer is a global problem, and a large number of new cases are diagnosed every year. Capecitabine is effective in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Hand-foot syndrome (HFS) is a common adverse effect of capecitabine. In this study, we investigated the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes involved in capecitabine metabolism pathways and capecitabine-induced HFS in Chinese patients with MBC to identify some predictive genetic biomarkers. METHODS:We selected 3 genes involved in capecitabine metabolism and screened genetic variants in these target genes.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'rs2853741 MTHFR rs3737964 MTHFR rs4846048', 'TYMS rs2606241 TYMS rs2853741 MTHFR', 'rs2606241 TYMS rs2853741 MTHFR rs3737964', 'MTHFR rs3737964 MTHFR rs4846048'",
