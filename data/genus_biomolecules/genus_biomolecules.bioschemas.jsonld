  "sc:description": "A database of genus characteristics of proteins and RNA.\n\nA database of genus characteristics.\n\nThe Genus database collects information about topological structure and complexity of proteins and RNA chains, which is captured by the genus of a given chain and its subchains. For each biomolecule this information is shown in the form of a genus trace plot, as well as a genus matrix diagram. We assemble such information for all protein and RNA structures deposited in the PDB. This database presents also various statistics and extensive information about biological function of analyzed biomolecules. Moreover, users can analyze their own structures",
