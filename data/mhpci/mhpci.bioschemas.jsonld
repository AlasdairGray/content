  "sc:description": "Development and validation of the mental health professional culture inventory.\n\nAIMS:No instrument has been developed to explicitly assess the professional culture of mental health workers interacting with severely mentally ill people in publicly or privately run mental health care services. Because of theoretical and methodological concerns, we designed a self-administered questionnaire to assess the professional culture of mental health services workers. The study aims to validate this tool, named the Mental Health Professional Culture Inventory (MHPCI). The MHPCI adopts the notion of 'professional culture' as a hybrid construct between the individual and the organisational level that could be directly associated with the professional practices of mental health workers.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
