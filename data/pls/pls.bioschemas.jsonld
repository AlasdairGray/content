      "sc:description": "an investigation of the effect of nonlinearity and sparsity on the decoding of intracranial data.\n\nOBJECTIVE:Partial Least Squares regression is a suitable linear decoder model for correlated and high dimensional neural data. This algorithm has been widely used in the application of brain-computer interface (BCI) for decoding of motor parameters. PLS does not consider nonlinear relations between brain signal features. The nonlinear version of PLS that considers a nonlinear relationship between the latent variables has not been proposed for the decoding of intracranial data. This nonlinear model may cause overfitting in some cases due to more number of free parameters. In this paper, we develop a new version of nonlinear PLS namely nonlinear sparse PLS (NLS PLS) and test it in the BCI applications.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'nonlinear PLS', 'nonlinear'",
