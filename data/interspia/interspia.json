                "abstract": "Â© The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.Proteins perform biological functions through cascading interactions with each other by forming protein complexes. As a result, interactions among proteins, called protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are not completely free from selection constraint during evolution. Therefore, the identification and analysis of PPI changes during evolution can give us new insight into the evolution of functions. Although many algorithms, databases and websites have been developed to help the study of PPIs, most of them are limited to visualize the structure and features of PPIs in a chosen single species with limited functions in the visualization perspective. This leads to difficulties in the identification of different patterns of PPIs in different species and their functional consequences. To resolve these issues, we developed a web application, called INTER-Species Protein Interaction Analysis (INTERSPIA). Given a set of proteins of user's interest, INTERSPIA first discovers additional proteins that are functionally associated with the input proteins and searches for different patterns of PPIs in multiple species through a server-side pipeline, and second visualizes the dynamics of PPIs in multiple species using an easy-to-use web interface.
