  "sc:description": "An open-source video analysis pipeline for the investigation of animal behavior.\n\nThis repository contains iPython files that can be used to track the location, motion, and freezing of an animal. For the sake of clarity, these processes are described as two modules: one for the analysis of freezing; the other for tracking an animal's location. If you are unfamiliar with how to use iPython/Jupyter Notebook, please see Getting Started.\n\nPlease see our biorxiv preprint (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/592592v2) for ezTrack video tutorials (Supplementary Videos 1 and 2) and for validation of tracking",
