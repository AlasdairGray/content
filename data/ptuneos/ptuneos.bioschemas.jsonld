With raw whole-exome sequencing data and/or RNA-seq data, pTuneos calculates five important immunogenicity features to construct a machine learning-based classifier (Pre&RecNeo) to predict and prioritize neoantigens recognized by T cell, followed by an efficient score scheme (RefinedNeo) to ealuate naturally processed, MHC presented and T cell recognized probability of a predicted neoepitope",
