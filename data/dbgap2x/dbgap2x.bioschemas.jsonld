We created a decryption function that uses a dockerized version on sratoolkit. To use that function, you need to have docker installed on your device (www.docker.com). If you are using the dockerized version of this software (available at hub.docker.com/r/gversmee/dbgap2x), docker is already pre-installed, but you'll need to upload your key on the jupyter working directory",
