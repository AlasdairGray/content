Often estimated from the ratio of volume to flow rate, τ equates the physical environment with dynamics of growth. We proposed that τ is key to understanding relationships between biodiversity and the physical ecosystem.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'ecosystem-levels', '+', 'biodiversity', 'congruous'",
