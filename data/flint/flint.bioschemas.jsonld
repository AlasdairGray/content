  "sc:description": "> CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'IMPLEMENTATION:Flint' | Large scale microbiome profiling in the cloud | Main repository of the Flint project for Spark and Amazon EMR | This is the main repository of the Flint project for Amazon Web Services. Flint is a metagenomics profiling pipeline that is built on top of the Apache Spark framework, and is designed for fast real-time profiling of metagenomic samples against a large collection of reference genomes. Flint takes advantage of Spark's built-in parallelism and streaming engine architecture to quickly map reads against a large reference collection of bacterial genomes",
