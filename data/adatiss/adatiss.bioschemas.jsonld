      "sc:description": "A Novel Data-Adaptive Robust Method for Quantifying Tissue Specificity Scores.\n\nAbstract Motivation Accurately detecting tissue specificity (TS) in genes helps researchers understand tissue functions at the molecular level, and further identify disease mechanisms and discover tissue-specific therapeutic targets. The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project (Consortium, 2015), and the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) project (Uhl√©n, et al., 2015) are two publicly available data resources, providing large-scale gene expressions across multiple tissue types. Multiple tissue comparisons, technical background noise and unknown variation factors make it challenging to accurately identify tissue specific gene expressions. Several methods worked on measuring the overall TS in gene expressions and classifying genes into tissue-enrichment categories.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'GTEx' (bio.tools/gtex), 'data-adaptive'",
