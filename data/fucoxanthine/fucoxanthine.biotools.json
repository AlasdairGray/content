    "description": "Fucoxanthin\u00a0is a natural pigment found in microalgae, especially diatoms and\u00a0Chrysophyta. Recently, it has been shown to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and anti-obesity activity in humans. Fucoxanthin increases the amount of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), a fatty acid-stimulated protein involved in respiration and thermogenesis in WAT of mice and rats.",
