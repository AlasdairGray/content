description: Package for calculating aggregated isotopic distribution and exact center-masses
  for chemical substances (in this version composed of C, H, N, O and S). This is
  an implementation of the BRAIN algorithm described in the paper by J. Claesen, P.
  Dittwald, T. Burzykowski and D. Valkenborg.
