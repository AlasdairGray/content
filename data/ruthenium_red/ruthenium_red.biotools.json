    "description": "Ruthenium red is an inhibitor of mitochondrial Ca\u00b2\u207a uniporter; also blocks cell membrane-located capsaicin-activated cation channels (IC\u2085\u2080 = 14 nM) and voltage-sensitive Ca\u00b2\u207a channels to inhibit neurotransmitter release. Besides, it specifically blocks the curcumin-induced apoptosis in U937 cells.",
