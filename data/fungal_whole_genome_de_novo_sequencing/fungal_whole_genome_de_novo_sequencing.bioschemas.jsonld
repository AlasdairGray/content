  "sc:description": "CD Genomics provides fungal whole genome sequencing with the PacBio Sequel system to offer more insights into genetic structure and functions. We are best in the knowledge, practise, and experience. PacBio, the third-generation sequencers, is highly robust and cost-effective and should be the platform of choice in sequencing fungi genomes, particularly for those that are well-known to be difficult-to-sequence. CD Genomics has extensive experience to offer the fungi whole genome sequencing service. Please contact us for more information and a detailed quote.",
