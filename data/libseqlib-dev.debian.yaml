  description: C++ htslib/bwa-mem/fermi interface for interrogating sequence data
    (dev)
  long_description: " C++ API and command line tool that provides a rapid and user-friendly\n\
    \ interface to BAM/SAM/CRAM files, global sequence alignment operations\n and\
    \ sequence assembly. Four C libraries perform core operations in\n SeqLib: HTSlib\
    \ for BAM access, BWA-MEM and BLAT for sequence alignment\n and Fermi for error\
    \ correction and sequence assembly. Benchmarking\n indicates that SeqLib has lower\
    \ CPU and memory requirements than leading\n C++ sequence analysis APIs. Minimal\
    \ SeqLib code can extract, error-correct\n and assemble reads from a CRAM file\
    \ and then align with BWA-MEM.\n SeqLib also provides additional capabilities,\
    \ including chromosome-aware\n interval queries and read plotting. Command line\
    \ tools are available for\n performing integrated error correction, micro-assemblies\
    \ and alignment.\n .\n This package contains the header files and static library.\n"
