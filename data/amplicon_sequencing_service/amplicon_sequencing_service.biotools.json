    "description": "Amplicon sequencing is based on NGS technology or PacBio SMRT sequencing. The ultra-deep sequencing of amplicons (PCR products) allows efficient variant identification and characterization. This technique has a wide range of applications, including 16S/18S/ITS gene sequencing, SNP genotyping, CRISPR sequencing, somatic/complex variant discovery, antibody screening sequencing, immune repertoire sequencing, et al.\n\nWhether you would like to detect the diversity of microbial communities or discover rare somatic mutations in complex samples. CD Genomics could provide professional, cost-efficient and high-speed amplicon sequencing services to meet your project requirements.",
