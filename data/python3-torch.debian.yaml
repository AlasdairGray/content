  description: Tensors and Dynamic neural networks in Python with strong GPU acceleration
  long_description: " PyTorch is a Python package that provides two high-level features:\n\
    \ .\n (1) Tensor computation (like NumPy) with strong GPU acceleration\n (2) Deep\
    \ neural networks built on a tape-based autograd system\n .\n You can reuse your\
    \ favorite Python packages such as NumPy, SciPy and Cython\n to extend PyTorch\
    \ when needed.\n .\n This is the CPU-only version of PyTorch and Caffe2 (Python\
    \ interface).\n"
