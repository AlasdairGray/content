  description: annotate miRNAs with a standard mirna/isomir naming (Python 3)
  long_description: " The main goal of this project is to create a reflection group\
    \ on metazoan\n microRNAs (miRNAs), open to all interested researchers, to identify\
    \ blockages\n and develop standards and guidelines to improve miRNA research,\
    \ resources and\n communication. This can go through the use of standardized file\
    \ formats, gene\n and variants nomenclature guidelines, and advancements in miRNA\
    \ biology\n understanding. The group will eventually also aim at expanding its\
    \ breadth to\n the development of novel tools, data resources, and best-practices\
    \ guidelines\n to benefit the scientific community by providing high confidence\
    \ validated\n research and analysis strategies, regardless the expertise in this\
    \ field.\n This package provides the Python modules for mirtop to execute correctly.\n"
