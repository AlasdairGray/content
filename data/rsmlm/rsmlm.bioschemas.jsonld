This package includes methods for persistence based clustering (ToMATo), alongside DBSCAN, Voronoi tessellation and Ripley's K based clustering. There is also the capacity to simulate dSTORM data.\n\nA set of Binder ready tutorials and demos showcasing this package can be found within the SMLM-tutorials repository. We recommend looking at these before installing the package.\n\ninstall_github(\"jeremypike/RSMLM\").\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'AVAILABILITY:RSMLM'",
