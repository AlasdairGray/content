  description: Interface to access neuroimaging data on XNAT servers
  long_description: " pyxnat is a simple Python library that relies on the REST API\
    \ provided\n by the XNAT platform since its 1.4 version. XNAT is an extensible\n\
    \ database for neuroimaging data. The main objective is to ease\n communications\
    \ with an XNAT server to plug-in external tools or Python\n scripts to process\
    \ the data. It features:\n .\n  - resources browsing capabilities\n  - read and\
    \ write access to resources\n  - complex searches\n  - disk-caching of requested\
    \ files and resources\n"
