    "description": "Creative Enzymes builds efficient purification methods on the foundation of comprehensive understanding and practical experiences of enzyme separation. We provide a group of isolation and purification methods to satisfy the post-expression needs in further applications. Given particular situations of each sample, Creative Enzymes chooses and sometimes develops the most suitable purify method in each case. Hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) represent one of the most widely used methods in enzyme purification. The expertise of Creative Enzymes on high-quality HIC will support your research demands.",
