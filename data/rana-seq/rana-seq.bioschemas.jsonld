  "sc:description": "Interactive RNA-Seq analysis from FASTQ files to functional analysis.\n\nUnregistered user, login or register.\n\nRaNA-Seq is an open bioinformatics tool for the quick analysis of RNA-Seq data. It performs a full analysis in minutes quantifying FASTQ files, calculating quality control metrics, running differential expression analyses and enabling the interpretation of results with functional analyses. Our analysis pipeline integrates cutting edge bioinformatics tools and simplify its application with a friendly Web interface designed for non-experienced users in these analyses. Each analysis can be customized setting up input parameters and applies generally accepted and reproducible protocols. Analysis results are presented as interactive graphics and reports, ready for their interpretation and publication.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'SUMMARY:RaNA-Seq', 'AVAILABILITY:RaNA-Seq'",
