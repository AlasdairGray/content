  description: development headers for libminimap
  long_description: " Minimap2 is a versatile sequence alignment program that aligns\
    \ DNA or\n mRNA sequences against a large reference database. Typical use cases\n\
    \ include: (1) mapping PacBio or Oxford Nanopore genomic reads to the\n human\
    \ genome; (2) finding overlaps between long reads with error rate up\n to ~15%;\
    \ (3) splice-aware alignment of PacBio Iso-Seq or Nanopore cDNA\n or Direct RNA\
    \ reads against a reference genome; (4) aligning Illumina\n single- or paired-end\
    \ reads; (5) assembly-to-assembly alignment; (6) full-\n genome alignment between\
    \ two closely related species with divergence\n below ~15%.\n .\n This package\
    \ contains the C library headers for using minimap in custom tools,\n along with\
    \ a static library.\n"
