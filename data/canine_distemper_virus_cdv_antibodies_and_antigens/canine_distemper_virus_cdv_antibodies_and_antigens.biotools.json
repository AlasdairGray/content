    "description": "Canine distemper virus (CDV), currently known as Canine morbillivirus, belongs to the Paramyxoviridae family, genus Morbillivirus, and is the etiological agent of canine distemper. It is considered as a highly contagious and an acutely febrile disease in dogs that has been known since 1760. It is associated with multiple cell tropism (epithelial, lymphoid and neurological), which leads to a systemic infection including respiratory, digestive, urinary, lymphatic, cutaneous, skeletal, and central nervous system (CNS) diseases.",
