  "sc:description": "Computer-Assisted Natural Products Anticipation.\n\n<p>Traditional natural products discovery workflows implying a combination of different targeting strategies including structure- and or bioactivity-based approaches, afford no information about new compound structure until late in the discovery pipeline. By integrating a MS MS prediction module and a collaborative library of (bio)chemical transformations, we have developed a new platform, coined MetWork, that is able of anticipating the structural identity of metabolites starting from any identified compound.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'MetWork' (bio.tools/MetWork), 'networking-based', 'alkaloids'",
