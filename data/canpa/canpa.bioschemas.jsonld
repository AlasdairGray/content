By integrating a MS MS prediction module and a collaborative library of (bio)chemical transformations, we have developed a new platform, coined MetWork, that is able of anticipating the structural identity of metabolites starting from any identified compound.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'MetWork' (bio.tools/MetWork), 'networking-based', 'alkaloids'",
