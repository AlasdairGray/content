  description: library for analysing high-throughput sequencing data
  long_description: " This package installs the Python 3 libraries of the bcbio-nextgen\n\
    \ toolkit implementing best-practice pipelines for fully automated high\n throughput\
    \ sequencing analysis.\n .\n A high-level configuration file specifies inputs\
    \ and analysis parameters\n to drive a parallel pipeline that handles distributed\
    \ execution,\n idempotent processing restarts and safe transactional steps.  The\
    \ project\n contributes a shared community resource that handles the data processing\n\
    \ component of sequencing analysis, providing researchers with more time\n to\
    \ focus on the downstream biology.\n"
