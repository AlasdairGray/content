  description: simple header-only C++ argument parser library
  long_description: " Args is a simple, small, flexible, header-only C++ argument\n\
    \ parssing library.\n .\n This is designed to appear somewhat similar to Python's\
    \ argparse, but in\n C++, with static type checking, and hopefully a lot faster\
    \ (also\n allowing fully nestable group logic, where Python's argparse does not).\n"
