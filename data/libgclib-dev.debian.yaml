  description: header files for Genome Code Lib (GCLib)
  long_description: " This is an eclectic gathering of (mostly) C++ code which upstream\
    \ used\n for some bioinformatics projects. The main idea is to provide\n lean\
    \ code and efficient data structures, trying to avoid too many code\n dependencies\
    \ of heavy libraries while minimizing production cycles (and\n this also implies\
    \ a decent compile/build time -- looking at you,\n bloated configure scripts and\
    \ lengthy compile times of Boost code or\n other heavy C++ template code..).\n\
    \ .\n This code was gathered even before the C++ STL had been fully adopted as\n\
    \ a cross-platform \"standard\". Since STL by itself is a bit heavier for\n most\
    \ of the C++ needs, it is preferred to use simpler&leaner C++ classes\n or templates\
    \ for basic strings, containers, basic algorithms etc.\n .\n Header files of Genome\
    \ Code Lib. It is mainly known for being\n used by StringTie but with its own\
    \ release cycle.\n"
