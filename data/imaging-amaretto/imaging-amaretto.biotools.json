METHODS Here, we present the Imaging-AMARETTO algorithms and software tools to systematically interrogate regulatory networks derived from multiomics data within and across related patient studies for their relevance to radiography and histopathology imaging features predicting clinical outcomes. RESULTS To demonstrate its utility, we applied Imaging-AMARETTO to integrate three patient studies of brain tumors, specifically, multiomics with radiography imaging data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and low-grade glioma (LGG) cohorts and transcriptomics with histopathology imaging data from the Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas Project (IvyGAP) GBM cohort. Our results show that ImagingAMARETTO recapitulates known key drivers of tumor-associated microglia and macrophage mechanisms, mediated by STAT3, AHR, and CCR2, and neurodevelopmental and stemness mechanisms, mediated by OLIG2. Imaging-AMARETTO provides interpretation of their underlying molecular mechanisms in light of imaging biomarkers of clinical outcomes and uncovers novel master drivers, THBS1 and MAP2, that establish relationships across these distinct mechanisms. CONCLUSION Our network-based imaging genomics tools serve as hypothesis generators that facilitate the interrogation of known and uncovering of novel hypotheses for follow-up with experimental validation studies. We anticipate that our Imaging-AMARETTO imaging genomics tools will be useful to the community of biomedical researchers for applications to similar studies of cancer and other complex diseases with available multiomics, imaging, and clinical data.",
