                "abstract": "\u00a9 2020 The Author(s)Pseudouridine synthase binds to uridine sites and catalyzes the conversion of uridine to pseudouridine (\u03a8). This binding takes place in a specific context and in the conformation of nucleotides. Most machine-learning methods for \u03a8 site classification use nucleotide frequency as a feature, which may not fully depict the relevant conformation around a \u03a8 site. Using the power of deep learning and raw sequence, as well as secondary structure features, our tool MU-PseUDeep is designed to capture both the sequence and secondary structure context, which inputs the raw RNA sequence and the predicted secondary structure to two sets of convolutional neural networks. It has shown considerable improvement in \u03a8 site prediction over existing tools, XG-PseU, PseUI, and iRNA-PseU for both balanced and imbalanced datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most accurate tool for \u03a8 site prediction. We also used MU-PseUDeep to scan the human transcriptome, which shows that the genes with predicted \u03a8 sites are enriched in nucleotide and protein binding, as well as in neurodegeneration pathways. The tool is open source, available at https://github.com/smk5g5/MU-PseUDeep.",
