  "sc:description": "a chimeric histone chaperone with functional nucleoplasmin and PPIase domains.\n\nFKBP53 is one of the seven multi-domain FK506-binding proteins present in Arabidopsis thaliana, and it is known to get targeted to the nucleus. It has a conserved PPIase domain at the C-terminus and a highly charged N-terminal stretch, which has been reported to bind to histone H3 and perform the function of a histone chaperone. To better understand the molecular details of this PPIase with histone chaperoning activity, we have solved the crystal structures of its terminal domains and functionally characterized them. The C-terminal domain showed strong PPIase activity, no role in histone chaperoning and revealed a monomeric five-beta palm-like fold that wrapped over a helix, typical of an FK506-binding domain.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'PPIase', 'nucleoplasmin', 'FK506-binding', 'chaperoning'",
