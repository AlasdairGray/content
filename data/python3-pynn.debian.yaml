  description: simulator-independent specification of neuronal network models
  long_description: " PyNN allows for coding a model once and run it without modification\n\
    \ on any simulator that PyNN supports (currently NEURON, NEST, PCSIM\n and Brian).\
    \  PyNN translates standard cell-model names and parameter\n names into simulator-specific\
    \ names.\n"
