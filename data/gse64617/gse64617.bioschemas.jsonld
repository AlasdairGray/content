      "sc:description": "Prediction and analysis of weighted genes in isoflurane induced general anesthesia based on network analysis.\n\nPurpose: Isoflurane is still wildly used in the developing countries and isoflurane-induced general anesthesia gives rise to serious side effects. The aim of the present study was to investigate the molecular mechanism on isoflurane-induced general anesthesia. Materials and methods: The microarray data of GSE64617 dataset was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. A total of 755 DEGs were identified using the limma package in the R programming language. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes, and Genomes (KEGG) pathways enrichment were conducted for DEGs.\n\n||| NAME (GSE64617) SIMILAR TO (PUB. DIFFERENT) bio.tools/GSE33335 (GSE33335), bio.tools/GSE56348 (GSE56348), bio.tools/GSE117578 (GSE117578), bio.tools/gse (GSE).\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'isoflurane', 'anesthesia', 'HMBOX1', 'isoflurane-induced'",
