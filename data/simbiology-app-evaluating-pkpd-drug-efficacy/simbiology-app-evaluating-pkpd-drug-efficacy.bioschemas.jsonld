  "sc:description": "This package contains an example of a MATLAB® application built using GUIDE for simulating a SimBiology® model. The SimBiology® model that is included is based on a tumor growth model developed by Koch, Walz, Lahu, and Schropp. Users can use the app as an example interface for entering an initial tumor weight, cell line, and dosing schedule, in order to simulate tumor growth inhibition in response to different drug therapies and generate a report. Using MATLAB Compiler®, the SimBiology® model can be deployed as part of a standalone MATLAB® app for distribution to other users.",
