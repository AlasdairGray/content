  "sc:description": "an interactive web application for comprehensive DNA methylation analysis and visualization.\n\nBACKGROUND:Data mining of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data has significantly facilitated cancer genome research and provided unprecedented opportunities for cancer researchers. However, existing web applications for DNA methylation analysis does not adequately address the need of experimental biologists, and many additional functions are often required. RESULTS:To facilitate DNA methylation analysis, we present the SMART (Shiny Methylation Analysis Resource Tool) App, a user-friendly and easy-to-use web application for comprehensively analyzing the DNA methylation data of TCGA project",
