Life-threatening Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infections strike across our society, both in the community and hospital settings. In recent years whole genome shotgun sequencing of clinical isolates has become common. As of August 2017 there were over 44,000 publicly available S. aureus sequencing projects in EBI's ENA database. Staphopia aims to provide rapid analysis of these whole-genome datasets as well as useful S. aureus specific results, such as genotype, antibiotic resistance and virulence gene profiles.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/glycopattern (EMORY.EDU)",
