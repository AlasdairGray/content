  "sc:description": "Scar shape analysis and simulated electrical instabilities in a non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy patient cohort.\n\nAn automated script for extracting the scar area, entropy, components, transmurality, radiality and interface length from short axis late gadolinium enhanced cardiac MRI images in nifti format.\n\nThis repository provides a script that creates a list of metrics quantifying a scar pattern seen in a cardiac short axis late gadolinium enhanced MRI image. The metrics provided are.\n\narea - The total area of the scar.\n\nradiality - The angular extent of the LGE pattern, with values between 0 and 1. A score of 1 indicates that scars are present in a full 360 degree pattern with respect to the centre of the blood pool, wheras 0 indicates no angular extent of scar.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'reentry', 'transmurality', 'non-ischemic', 'fibrotic'",
