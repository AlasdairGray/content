    "description": "Active His6-rhTG3 is based on the TGM3-allele from clone DKFZp686J0716 (isolated from different tissues), corrected by the insertion of the missing T at Position 435. It is N-terminally fused to a hexahistidine-tag resulting in the encoded N-terminal amino acid sequence MHHHHHHAALGV\u2026 .His6-rhTG3 is produced in insect cells and purified by ion metal chelating and ion exchange chromatography to more than 95 % purity. The active Form is obtained by treatment with Dispase I. Active His6-rhTG3 is a Ca2+-dependent enzyme.",
