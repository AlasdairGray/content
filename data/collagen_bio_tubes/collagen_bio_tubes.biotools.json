They are available with a diameter of 4.5 mm or 2.5 mm and each with a length of 3 cm or 6 cm.Like the Collagen Cell Carrier, they can be used for growth and differentiation of various cell types, representing an in vivo-like collagen for use in bioreactors in fluidic systems or conventional cell culture-treated well plates.",
