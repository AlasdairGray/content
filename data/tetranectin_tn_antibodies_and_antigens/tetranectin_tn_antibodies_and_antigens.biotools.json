    "description": "Tetranectin (TN) is a member of the C-type lectin superfamily produced by many different cell types, such as monocytes, neutrophils, and fibroblasts. It is an important component of the ECM during muscle cell development and regeneration which can be detected in serum and the extracellular matrix (ECM). This protein is also expressed during skeletal development and is thought to have mineralization during osteogenesis.",
