  "sc:description": "> LOW CONFIDENCE! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'NEEDS study' | a protocol for a cross-sectional smartphone tracking study and a longitudinal population register study | Dynamic Urban Environmental Exposures on Depression and Suicide | Depression is among the leading health burdens worldwide and people affected by depression have a higher suicide risk. Environmental exposures may act as potential stressors or buffers to peopleâ€™s mental health status. How much the environment (e.g. urban design, green space, social interaction) contributes to depression and suicide risk remains unclear and evidence tends to be limited to the residential environment. NEEDS calls such environmental exposure assessments into question",
