The first attempt took place around Volume 35 No 2 on CILIP Social Link (link may require CILIP login and may not take you to the right place). Unfortunately we found SocialLink did not really offer quite what was….\n\nThanks to an idea from Alan Fricker, we're reading articles from HILJ for our CPD.\n\nHealth librarian and info skills trainer.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'HILJ Club'",
