  "sc:description": "> LOW CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'RCSB', 'RCSB Protein', 'RCSB Protein Data', 'RCSB Protein Data Bank' | Software for Biomolecular Illustration | The small program Illustrate generates non-photorealistic images of biological molecules for use in dissemination, outreach, and education. The method has been used as part of the \"Molecule of the Month,\" an ongoing educational column at the RCSB Protein Data Bank (http: rcsb.org). Insights from 20 years of application of the program are presented, and the program has been released both as open-source Fortran at GitHub and through an interactive web-based interface",
