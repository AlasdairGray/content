description: Nanopolish uses a signal-level hidden Markov model for consensus calling
  of nanopore genome sequencing data. It can perform signal-level analysis of Oxford
  Nanopore sequencing data. Nanopolish can calculate an improved consensus sequence
  for a draft genome assembly, detect base modifications, call SNPs and indels with
  respect to a reference genome and more.
