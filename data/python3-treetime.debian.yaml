  description: inference of time stamped phylogenies and ancestral reconstruction
    (Python 3)
  long_description: " TreeTime provides routines for ancestral sequence reconstruction\
    \ and the\n maximum likelihoo inference of molecular-clock phylogenies, i.e.,\
    \ a tree\n where all branches are scaled such that the locations of terminal nodes\n\
    \ correspond to their sampling times and internal nodes are placed at the\n most\
    \ likely time of divergence.\n .\n TreeTime aims at striking a compromise between\
    \ sophisticated\n probabilistic models of evolution and fast heuristics. It implements\
    \ GTR\n models of ancestral inference and branch length optimization, but takes\n\
    \ the tree topology as given. To optimize the likelihood of time-scaled\n phylogenies,\
    \ treetime uses an iterative approach that first infers\n ancestral sequences\
    \ given the branch length of the tree, then optimizes\n the positions of unconstraine\
    \ d nodes on the time axis, and then repeats\n this cycle. The only topology optimization\
    \ are (optional) resolution of\n polytomies in a way that is most (approximately)\
    \ consistent with the\n sampling time constraints on the tree. The package is\
    \ designed to be\n used as a stand-alone tool or as a library used in larger phylogenetic\n\
    \ analysis workflows.\n .\n Features\n  * ancestral sequence reconstruction (marginal\
    \ and joint maximum\n    likelihood)\n  * molecular clock tree inference (marginal\
    \ and joint maximum\n    likelihood)\n  * inference of GTR models\n  * rerooting\
    \ to obtain best root-to-tip regression\n  * auto-correlated relaxed molecular\
    \ clock (with normal prior)\n .\n This package provides the Python 3 module.\n"
