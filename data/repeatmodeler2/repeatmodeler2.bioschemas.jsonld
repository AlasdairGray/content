At the heart of RepeatModeler are three de-novo repeat finding programs ( RECON, RepeatScout and LtrHarvest/Ltr_retriever ) which employ complementary computational methods for identifying repeat element boundaries and family relationships from sequence data.\n\n||| NAME (RepeatModeler2) SIMILAR TO (PUB.
