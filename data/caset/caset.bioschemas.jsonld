  "sc:description": "Distance Measures for Tumor Evolutionary Trees.\n\nMOTIVATION:There has been recent increased interest in using algorithmic methods to infer the evolutionary tree underlying the developmental history of a tumor. Quantitative measures that compare such trees are vital to a number of different applications including benchmarking tree inference methods and evaluating common inheritance patterns across patients. However, few appropriate distance measures exist, and those that do have low resolution for differentiating trees or do not fully account for the complex relationship between tree topology and the inheritance of the mutations labeling that topology.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'DISC', 'CASet DISC', 'IMPLEMENTATION:Implementations', 'IMPLEMENTATION:Implementations CASet'",
