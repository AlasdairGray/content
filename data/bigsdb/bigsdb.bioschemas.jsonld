Reversal of Carbapenem and Amikacin Susceptibilities in Isogenic Klebsiella pneumoniae From a Patient with Persistent Bacteriuria.\n\nInstitut Pasteur MLST databases and software.\n\nThis site hosts databases of multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and whole-genome based typing schemes, which are used for genotyping of bacterial isolates. They provide reference nomenclatures of microbial strains and are mainly intended for molecular epidemiology of pathogens of public health importance, detection of virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes, and for population biology research. This site is powered by the BIGSdb software.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'CGE', 'CLC Genomics', 'CLSI guidelines', 'cultures grew'",
