      "sc:description": "a robust collaborative matrix factorization method to predict miRNA-disease associations.\n\nBACKGROUND:Predicting miRNA-disease associations (MDAs) is time-consuming and expensive. It is imminent to improve the accuracy of prediction results. So it is crucial to develop a novel computing technology to predict new MDAs. Although some existing methods can effectively predict novel MDAs, there are still some shortcomings. Especially when the disease matrix is processed, its sparsity is an important factor affecting the final results. RESULTS:A robust collaborative matrix factorization (RCMF) is proposed to predict novel MDAs. The L2,1-norm are introduced to our method to achieve the highest AUC value than other advanced methods.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'MDAs', 'miRNA-disease', 'BACKGROUND:Predicting', 'CONCLUSIONS:5-fold'",
