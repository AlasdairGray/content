A 'projectome' is a large-scale mapping between regions of the brain, created from fMRI or DTI. Data are from a multitude of labs and experiments. The data are run through m2g, and after processing, we provide summary statistics, QA, and the projectomes themselves.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'atlases'",
