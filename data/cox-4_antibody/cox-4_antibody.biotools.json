    "description": "Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) is a 13-subunit complex spanning the inner mitochondrial membrane and responsible for the terminal reduction of dioxygen to water in the electron transport chain. The three core catalytic units COX-1, -2, -3 are trans-membrane proteins encoded by the mitochondrial genome, whereas the remaining 10 subunits are nuclear encoded and expressed in a tissue-specific manner.",
