      "sc:description": "Exhaustive Repertoire of Druggable Cavities at Protein-Protein Interfaces of Known Three-Dimensional Structure.\n\nProtein-protein interactions (PPIs) offer the unique opportunity to tailor ligands aimed at specifically stabilizing or disrupting the corresponding interfaces and providing a safer alternative to conventional ligands targeting monomeric macromolecules. Selecting biologically relevant protein-protein interfaces for either stabilization or disruption by small molecules is usually biology-driven on a case-by-case basis and does not follow a structural rationale that could be applied to an entire interactome. We herewith provide a first step to the latter goal by using a fully automated and structure-based workflow, applicable to any PPI of known three-dimensional (3D) structure, to identify and prioritize druggable cavities at and nearby PPIs of pharmacological interest.\n\n||| NAME EQUAL TO (PUB.
