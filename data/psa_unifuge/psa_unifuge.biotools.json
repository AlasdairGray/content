    "description": "All process contact surfaces are easy for installation and can be entirely replaced after each run. It realizes the harvesting of mammalian and insect cells at low shear, and maintains the viability of the recovered cells. UniFuge\u00ae is the best choice for cell recovery or centrate clarification since the generation of cell debris in the centrifuge is minimized. UniFuge\u00ae modules  are easily soldered to your disposable bioreactor (customized single-use connectors are available as requirement). It is fully automatic with flexible cycle parameter input. UniFuge\u00ae gently pumps the feed suspension into the module, and settles cells to the outer radius, while discarding clear supernatant and concentrate continuously. When the module is full, the controller will stop the rotor and release the cells. This cycle does not stop until the bioreactor volume has been processed.",
