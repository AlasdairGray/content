  "sc:description": "A novel smartphone application for women with or at risk of diabetes during pregnancy.\n\nMobile health (mHealth) applications (apps) have been recently introduced as an easily accessible tool for providing information to pregnant women with diabetes. Despite the growing number of apps on the topic \"diabetes & pregnancy\", a smartphone app offering comprehensive and individualized information to both women (before and during gestation) and their healthcare professionals was still missing. To overcome this lack, the Italian Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group conceived and realized in 2016 a novel mobile app called \"MySweetGestation\". It is designed to be an interactive educational tool for both patients and physicians not expert in the field.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
