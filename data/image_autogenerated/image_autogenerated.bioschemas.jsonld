Based on Fan, Yue; Vilgalys, Tauras P.; Sun, Shiquan; Peng, Qinke; Tung, Jenny; Zhou, Xiang (2019) <doi:10.1101/615039>.\n\nWe provide the detailed analysis scripts for IMAGE here.\n\nIMAGE is implemented as an open source R package for mQTL mapping in sequencing-based methylation studies.\n\nTo perfrom the comparative methods, put GEMMA.\n\n||| NAME EQUAL TO (PUB.
