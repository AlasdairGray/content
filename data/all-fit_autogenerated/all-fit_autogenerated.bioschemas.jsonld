      "sc:description": "Allele-Frequency-based Imputation of Tumor Purity from High-Depth Sequencing Data.\n\nMOTIVATION:Clinical sequencing aims to identify somatic mutations in cancer cells for accurate diagnosis and treatment. However, most widely used clinical assays lack patient-matched control DNA and additional analysis is needed to distinguish somatic and unfiltered germline variants. Such computational analyses require accurate assessment of tumor cell content in individual specimens. Histological estimates often do not corroborate with results from computational methods that are primarily designed for normal-tumor matched data and can be confounded by genomic heterogeneity and presence of sub-clonal mutations.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| NAME EQUAL TO (PUB. DIFFERENT) bio.tools/All-FIT.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'IMPLEMENTATION:Freely'",
