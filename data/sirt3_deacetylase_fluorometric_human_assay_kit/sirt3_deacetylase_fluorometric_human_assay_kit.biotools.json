    "description": "This kit is designed for the rapid and sensitive evaluation of SIRT3 inhibitors or activators using crude SIRT3 fraction or purified SIRT3. Additionally, any cultured primary cell, cell line, or tissue homogenate can be assayed for SIRT3 activity with the SIRT3 deacetylase fluorometric assay kit after immunoprecipitation with an appropriate SIRT3 specific antibody.",
