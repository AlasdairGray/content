However, comprehensive tools are not freely available to the research community. Here, we present the protein-ligand interaction profiler (PLIP), a novel web service for fully automated detection and visualization of relevant non-covalent protein-ligand contacts in 3D structures, freely available at projects.biotec.tu-dresden.de/plip-web. The input is either a Protein Data Bank structure, a protein or ligand name, or a custom protein-ligand complex (e.g. from docking). In contrast to other tools, the rule-based PLIP algorithm does not require any structure preparation. It returns a list of detected interactions on single atom level, covering seven interaction types (hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic contacts, pi-stacking, pi-cation interactions, salt bridges, water bridges and halogen bonds). PLIP stands out by offering publication-ready images, PyMOL session files to generate custom images and parsable result files to facilitate successive data processing. The full python source code is available for download on thewebsite. PLIP's command-line mode allows for high-throughput interaction profiling.",

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.With the growth of protein structure data, the analysis of molecular interactions between ligands and their target molecules is gaining importance. PLIP, the protein-ligand interaction profiler, detects and visualises these interactions and provides data in formats suitable for further processing. PLIP has proven very successful in applications ranging from the characterisation of docking experiments to the assessment of novel ligand-protein complexes. Besides ligand-protein interactions, interactions with DNA and RNA play a vital role in many applications, such as drugs targeting DNA or RNA-binding proteins. To date, over 7% of all 3D structures in the Protein Data Bank include DNA or RNA. Therefore, we extended PLIP to encompass these important molecules. We demonstrate the power of this extension with examples of a cancer drug binding to a DNA target, and an RNA-protein complex central to a neurological disease. PLIP is available online at https://plip-tool.biotec.tu-dresden.de and as open source code. So far, the engine has served over a million queries and the source code has been downloaded several thousand times.",
