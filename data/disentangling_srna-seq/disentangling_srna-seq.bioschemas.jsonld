  "sc:description": "Disentangling sRNA-Seq data to study RNA communication between species.\n\nWe provide a series of scripts to help separate small RNA sequencing data (sRNA-Seq) from libraries containing information from two interacting organisms.\n\nAssigning the correct organism to each small RNA read is particularly challenging relative to longer mRNA sequences (standard RNA-Seq protocols). Due to their short length (~20-25 nt) random mappings can occur in large genomes just by chance.\n\nWe show that increasing the length of sRNA sequences even by a few nucleotides can greatly decrease random mappings. We propose using de novo or genome-guided assembly of sRNA-Seq data, to increase sRNA length and help disambiguate the organism of origin.\n\nDisentangling sRNA-Seq data to study RNA communication between species. 2019.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'sRNA-Seq', 'sRNAs', 'Heligmosomoides', 'disentangle'",
