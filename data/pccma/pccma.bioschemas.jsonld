      "sc:description": "The development of the Primary Care Clusters Multidimensional Assessment (PCCMA).\n\nA strong primary care (PC) system is essential for an efficient and high-quality healthcare service. Many countries have adopted a model of PC that encourages different healthcare providers to work together, at scale, in multidisciplinary multiagency teams (PC clusters). The aim of the present work was to develop a quantitative instrument for the systematic and comprehensive assessment of PC clusters. This was a non-experimental, mixed-methods study grouping four work packages (WP), and involving PC cluster leads and a wide range of key stakeholders from across Wales. Interviews with 22 PC cluster leads (34 %) investigated the clusters' functioning (WP1). A systematic review identified relevant PC assessment frameworks and instruments (WP2).\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'development Primary Care Clusters Multidimensional Assessment', 'PC', 'WP', 'mixed-methods'",
