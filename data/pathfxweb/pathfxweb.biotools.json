Published by Oxford University Press.Summary: Limited efficacy and intolerable safety limit therapeutic development and identification of potential liabilities earlier in development could significantly improve this process. Computational approaches which aggregate data from multiple sources and consider the drug's pathways effects could add to identification of these liabilities earlier. Such computational methods must be accessible to a variety of users beyond computational scientists, especially regulators and industry scientists, in order to impact the therapeutic development process. We have previously developed and published PathFX, an algorithm for identifying drug networks and phenotypes for understanding drug associations to safety and efficacy. Here we present a streamlined and easy-to-use PathFX web application that allows users to search for drug networks and associated phenotypes. We have also added visualization, and phenotype clustering to improve functionality and interpretability of PathFXweb. Availability and implementation: https://www.pathfxweb.net/.
