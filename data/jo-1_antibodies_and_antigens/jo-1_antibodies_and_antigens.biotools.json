    "description": "Jo-1 (histidyl tRNA synthetase) is a member of the amino acyl-tRNA synthetase family of enzymes found in all nucleated cells[1]. The amino acid sequence of human Jo-1 antigen has been determined by cloning and sequencing its cDNA10. It contains three structural motifs typical of class IIa aminoacyl transferases and two signature regions common to histidyltRNA synthetases.",
