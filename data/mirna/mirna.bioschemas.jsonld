Currently predictions are available for Homo sapiens, Mus musculus and Rattus norvegicus (the last one through homology translation).\n\n# Running maSigPro on miRNAs in hpc.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/mirnatap (BIOCONDUCTOR.ORG/packages/release/bioc/html/miRNAtap.html).\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'organ-specific', 'miRNAs' (bio.tools/miRNAs), 'embryonic'",
