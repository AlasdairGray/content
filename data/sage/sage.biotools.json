    "description": "A comprehensive resource of genetic variants integrating South Asian whole genomes and exomes.\n\nSouth Asian Genomes and Exomes (CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology).\n\nSAGE is a comprehensive repertoire of genome and exome information from South Asians. We have integrated 6 datasets encompassing 1213 human genome and exome data to create a compendium of 154 million genetic variants. The resource has immense applications in understanding the allelic frequencies, carrier rates for rare genetic diseases and genetic traits including pharmacogenetics, apart from prioritising and discovering novel disease associated variants. The variants were systematically annotated, integrated with other public databases and and allele frequencies are available in this browsable resource.

Published by Oxford University Press.South Asia is home to \u223c20% of the world population and characterized by distinct ethnic, linguistic, cultural and genetic lineages. Only limited representative samples from the region have found its place in large population-scale international genome projects. The recent availability of genome scale data from multiple populations and datasets from South Asian countries in public domain motivated us to integrate the data into a comprehensive resource. In the present study, we have integrated a total of six datasets encompassing 1213 human exomes and genomes to create a compendium of 154 814 557 genetic variants and adding a total of 69 059 255 novel variants. The variants were systematically annotated using public resources and along with the allele frequencies are available as a browsable-online resource South Asian genomes and exomes. As a proof of principle application of the data and resource for genetic epidemiology, we have analyzed the pathogenic genetic variants causing retinitis pigmentosa. Our analysis reveals the genetic landscape of the disease and suggests subset of genetic variants to be highly prevalent in South Asia.",
