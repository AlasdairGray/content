  "sc:description": "PRECOG (Predicting coupling probabilities of G-protein coupled receptors) lets you predict coupling probabilities of Class A GPCRs to 11 G-proteins based on input sequence information (either WT or mutated). It is built by training logistic-regression algorithm on sequence- and structure-based features, derived from a set of Class A GPCRs.",
