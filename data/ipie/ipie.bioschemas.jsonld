      "sc:description": "Assessment of immunization practices in Belarus, Morocco, and Thailand.\n\nBACKGROUND:Vaccines for the control of seasonal influenza are recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for use in specific risk groups, but their use requires operational considerations that may challenge immunization programs. Several middle-income countries have recently implemented seasonal influenza vaccination. Early program evaluation following vaccine introduction can help ascertain positive lessons learned and areas for improvement. METHODS:An influenza vaccine post-introduction evaluation (IPIE) tool was developed jointly by WHO and the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to provide a systematic approach to assess influenza vaccine implementation processes.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Seasonal influenza vaccination middle-income countries', 'influenza vaccination', 'seasonal influenza', 'HWs'",
