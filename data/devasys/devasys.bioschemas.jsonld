  "sc:description": "Development of an Online Tool to Support Systematic Evaluation of Intervention Projects in Prevention and Health Promotion].\n\nOBJECTIVES:To date, knowledge about the effects and implementation quality of disease prevention and health promotion projects in Germany is limited. Only a few structured evaluation systems exist that can be easily used and which include features for evaluating research and practice projects. The aim of the current project was to develop and carry out a pilot study of an online evaluation tool that enables structured self-evaluation of projects in disease prevention and health promotion practice and contributes to an improved documentation and cyclical development of projects.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'prevention' (bio.tools/prevention), 'disease', 'RE-AIM' (bio.tools/RE-AIM), 'practice-oriented'",
