  description: fast protein contact predictor - binding for Python3
  long_description: " FreeContact is a protein residue contact predictor optimized\
    \ for speed.\n Its input is a multiple sequence alignment. FreeContact can function\
    \ as an\n accelerated drop-in for the published contact predictors\n EVfold-mfDCA\
    \ of DS. Marks (2011) and\n PSICOV of D. Jones (2011).\n .\n FreeContact is accelerated\
    \ by a combination of vector instructions, multiple\n threads, and faster implementation\
    \ of key parts.\n Depending on the alignment, 8-fold or higher speedups are possible.\n\
    \ .\n A sufficiently large alignment is required for meaningful results.\n As\
    \ a minimum, an alignment with an effective (after-weighting) sequence count\n\
    \ bigger than the length of the query sequence should be used. Alignments with\n\
    \ tens of thousands of (effective) sequences are considered good input.\n .\n\
    \ jackhmmer(1) from the hmmer package, or hhblits(1) from hhsuite\n can be used\
    \ to generate the alignments, for example.\n .\n This package contains the Python3\
    \ binding.\n"
