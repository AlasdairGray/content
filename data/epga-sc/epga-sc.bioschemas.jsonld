      "sc:description": "A framework for de novo assembly of single-cell sequencing reads.\n\nAssembling genomes from single-cell sequencing data is essential for single-cell studies. However, single-cell assemblies are challenging due to (i) the highly non-uniform read coverage and (ii) the elevated levels of sequencing errors and chimeric reads. In this study, we present a new framework called EPGA-SC for de novo assembly of single-cell sequencing reads. The EPGA assembler has designed strategies to solve the problems caused by sequencing errors, sequencing biases and repetitive regions. However, the extremely unbalanced and richer error types prevent EPGA to achieve high performance in single-cell sequencing data. In this study, we designed EPGA-SC based on EPGA.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
