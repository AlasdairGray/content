    "description": "Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase (PCK1) belongs to the lyase family. In the presence of GTP, it catalyzes the reversible conversion of oxaloacetate (OAA) into phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), GDP and CO2. In humans, two isoforms of PEPCK are found: cytosolic form (PCK1, also called PEPCK-C) and mitochondrial form (PEPCK-M). PCK1 is a control point enzyme which catalyzes a irreversible step in gluconeogenesis.",
