Though this is increasingly widely acknowledged, there is still a paucity of guiding resources as to how healthcare providers can obtain the knowledge and skills to initiate meaningful change. In order to help foster the development of QIPS, the following Resource Centre was created to guide training in the science of QIPS.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'QIPS teaching', 'teaching QIPS', 'Te4Q', 'Jump-Starting Faculty Development Quality Improvement Patient Safety Education'",
