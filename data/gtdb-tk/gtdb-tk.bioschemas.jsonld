It is designed to work with recent advances that allow hundreds or thousands of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) to be obtained directly from environmental samples. It can also be applied to isolate and single-cell genomes. The GTDB-Tk is open source and released under the GNU General Public License (Version 3).\n\nWelcome to GTDB GENOME TAXONOMY DATABASE 145,906 genomes Release 04-RS89 (19th June 2019).\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/GTDB (GTDB.ECOGENOMIC.ORG)",
