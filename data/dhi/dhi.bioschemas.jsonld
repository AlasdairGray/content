      "sc:description": "Diffusion Histology Imaging to Improve Lesion Detection and Classification in Multiple Sclerosis.\n\nBackground: Diagnosing MS through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) requires extensive clinical experience and tedious work. Furthermore, MRI-indicated MS lesion locations rarely align with the patients' symptoms and often contradict with pathology studies. Our lab has developed and modified a novel diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI) technique to address the shortcomings of MRI-based MS diagnoses. Although primary DBSI metrics have been demonstrated to be associated with axonal injury loss, demyelination and inflammation, a more detailed analysis using multiple DBSI-structural metrics to improve the accuracy of MS lesion detection and differentiation is still needed.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'DBSI'",
