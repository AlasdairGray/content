    "description": "Golgi phosphoprotein 3 (UniProt Q9H4A6; also known as Coat protein GPP34, MIDAS, Mitochondrial DNA absence factor) is encoded by the GOLPH3 (also known as GPP34) gene (Gene ID 64083) in human. GOLPH3 is a phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate- (PI4P-) binding protein that plays an essential role in vesicle trafficking and Golgi structure. GOLPH3 is localized to the trans-Golgi via tight binding to PI4P that is highly enriched at the trans-Golgi. GOLPH3 interacts and recruits the unconventional myosin MYO18A to the Golgi, allowing MYO18A and F-actin interaction.",
