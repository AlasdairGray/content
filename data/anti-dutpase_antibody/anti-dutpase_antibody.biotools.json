    "description": "dUTPase, also known as dUTP pyrophosphatase, and encoded by the gene DUT, is a critical enzyme involved in nucleotide metabolism for the production of dUMP, the immediate precursor of thymidine nucleotides. dUTPase normally can also function to decrease the intracellular concentration of dUTP so that uracil cannot be incorporated into DNA and cause mutations. dUTPase is localized to the nucleus and mitochondrial locations. dUTPase is expressed in numerous tissues and has multiple isoforms.",
