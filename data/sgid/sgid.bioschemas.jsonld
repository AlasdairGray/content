  "sc:description": "a comprehensive and interactive database of the silkworm | Silkworm Genome Informatics Database | e.g. FIBH or KWMTBOMO15365 or BGIBMGA005111 or silk fibroin heavy chain &nbspBrowse in Gene Lists | Search by sequence alignment against genomes or genes | With the Exponential increasing of sequencing data in genomics, transcriptomics and epigenetics, and the development of data analysis methods, a serious of informatics database with integrated analysis tools have been constructed, like the Flybase and TAIR. Silkworm, as a domesticated insect, lacks an online analysis platform. On the basis of previous efforts, including Silkbase, SilkDB and Ensembl Insects, we constructed the silkworm genome informatics database, SGID. Hopefully, it will assist to bioinformatics analysis of silkworms in the future",
