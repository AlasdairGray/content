    "description": "His6-rhTG2-Cys277Ser is based on the TGM2-allele from I.M.A.G.E.-clone IMAGp958L121020 isolated from neuroblastoma cells of the human brain (Val224-allele, Kanchan et al., Biochem. J. 2013, 455:261\u201372). It is N-terminally fused to a hexahistidine-tag resulting in the encoded N-terminal amino acid sequence MAHHHHHHAEELV. At position 277 Cysteine has been replaced by Serin. Please note that numerotation corresponds to the wild type protein without hexahistidine-tag. His6-rhTG2 is produced in E. coli and purified by ion metal chelating chromatography to more than 95 % purity.",
