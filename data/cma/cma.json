                "title": "CMA - A comprehensive Bioconductor package for supervised classification with high dimensional data", 
                "abstract": "Background: For the last eight years, microarray-based classification has been a major topic in statistics, bioinformatics and biomedicine research. Traditional methods often yield unsatisfactory results or may even be inapplicable in the so-called \"p ≫ n\" setting where the number of predictors p by far exceeds the number of observations n, hence the term \"ill-posed-problem\". Careful model selection and evaluation satisfying accepted good-practice standards is a very complex task for statisticians without experience in this area or for scientists with limited statistical background. The multiplicity of available methods for class prediction based on high-dimensional data is an additional practical challenge for inexperienced researchers. Results: In this article, we introduce a new Bioconductor package called CMA (standing for \"Classification for MicroArrays\") for automatically performing variable selection, parameter tuning, classifier construction, and unbiased evaluation of the constructed classifiers using a large number of usual methods. Without much time and effort, users are provided with an overview of the unbiased accuracy of most top-performing classifiers. Furthermore, the standardized evaluation framework underlying CMA can also be beneficial in statistical research for comparison purposes, for instance if a new classifier has to be compared to existing approaches. Conclusion: CMA is a user-friendly comprehensive package for classifier construction and evaluation implementing most usual approaches.
