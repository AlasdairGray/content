  "sc:description": "Modification of the genome topology network and its application to the comparison of group B Streptococcus genomes.\n\nThe draft genomes now can be analyzed. Initiate the GTN with \"gtn_CompleteOnly.pl\" if your data consist of complete genomes only, or utilize \"gtn_WithDraft.pl\". The GTN firstly locates the synteny block in genomes if draft data exist.\n\nThe Markov Cluster Algorithm is introduced to assign the gene families. The Markov Cluster (MCL) Algorithm is introduced in this version. This algorithm is also used in many clustering tool, such as orthoMCL,.\n\nUnique gene connection information will be yielded as a result file.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'GTN', 'MCL' (bio.tools/mcl), 'clades', 'RESULT:In'",
