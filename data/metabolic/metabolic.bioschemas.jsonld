These genome datasets can either be metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), single-cell amplified genomes (SAGs) or pure culture sequenced genomes. It can also calculate the genome coverage. The information is parsed and diagrams for elemental/biogeochemical cycling pathways (currently Nitrogen, Carbon, Sulfur and \"other\") are produced",
