  "sc:description": "Computational inference of epimutation rates and spectra from high-throughput DNA methylation data in plants.\n\nAlphaBeta is a computational method for estimating epimutation rates and spectra from high-throughput DNA methylation data in plants. The method has been specifically designed to: 1. analyze 'germline' epimutations in the context of multi-generational mutation accumulation lines (MA-lines). 2. analyze 'somatic' epimutations in the context of plant development and aging",
