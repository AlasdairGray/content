    "description": "Rabies lyssavirus, formerly Rabies virus, is a neurotropic virus that causes rabies in humans and animals. RABV has a non-segmented, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA genome about 12 kb in length, with five genes: L (RNA polymerase), G (glycoprotein), M (matrix protein), P (phosphoprotein), and N (nucleoprotein). The virus envelope contains glycosylated G-protein spikes that bind to cells.",
