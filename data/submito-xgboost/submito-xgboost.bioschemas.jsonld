  "sc:description": "predicting protein submitochondrial localization by fusing multiple feature information and eXtreme gradient boosting.\n\nMOTIVATION:Mitochondria are an essential organelle in most eukaryotes. They not only play an important role in energy metabolism but also take part in many critical cytopathological processes. Abnormal mitochondria can trigger a series of human diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, multifactor disorder, and Type-II diabetes. Protein submitochondrial localization enables the understanding of protein function in studying disease pathogenesis and drug design. RESULTS:We proposed a new method, SubMito-XGBoost, for protein submitochondrial localization prediction",
