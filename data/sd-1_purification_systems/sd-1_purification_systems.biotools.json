    "description": "A single configuration can handle reconnaissance operations and then scale up to purify samples of a few grams or even hundreds of grams. Standard systems can provide flow rates from 1 to 200 mL/min and can be easily upgraded to 500 mL/min. Purification options for complex samples include the 410 autosampler, 1260 Infinity II variable wavelength detector, and 440 fraction collector. OpenLAB CDS ChemStation software can fully control the workflow of analysis and preparation scale.",
