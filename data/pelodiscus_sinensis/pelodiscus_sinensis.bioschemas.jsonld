  "sc:description": "Transcriptome analysis provides insight into the role of the melanin pathway in two differently pigmented strains of the turtle Pelodiscus sinensis.\n\nPelodiscus sinensis is the most common turtle species raised in East and Southeast Asia. The Japanese strain and the Qingxi black strain are important aquatic breeds of P. sinensis in China with unique characteristics in terms of production performance and appearance, including skin color. In this study, melanin content measure and histological analysis on skin samples of these two strains were carried out to compare their color characteristics. The results showed that Qingxi black turtles clearly have a greater ability to deposit melanin than the Japanese strain especially in the abdomen.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Qingxi', 'sinensis', 'log2FoldChange', 'DESeq' (bio.tools/deseq)",
