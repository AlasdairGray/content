    "description": "CD genomics provides a ribosome-profiling strategy that is based on the deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments and enables genome-wide investigation of translation with sub cordon resolution. Using nuclease digestion, the ribosome position and the translated message can be precisely determined by analyzing the protected ~30-nt area of the mRNA template.",
