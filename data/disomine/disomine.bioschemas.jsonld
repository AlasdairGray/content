      "sc:description": "DisoMine is a tool that predicts protein disorder with recurrent neural networks not directly from the amino acid sequence, but instead from more generic predictions of key biophysical properties, here protein dynamics, secondary structure and early folding. The tool is fast and requires only a single sequence, making it applicable for large-scale screening, including poorly studied and orphan proteins. DisoMine compares well to 10 state of the art predictors, also if these use evolutionary information.",
