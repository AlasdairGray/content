The database is designed to facilitate the process for users to compare, confirm, and locate the most plausible location for genes responsible for quantitative traits important to cattle production. We have been striving our best to curate all available data, and adding tools to the QTLdb for users to accomplish many data meta-analysis and comparison tasks.\n\nThe current release of the Cattle QTLdb contains 130,407 QTLs associations from 983 publications.\n\nAll data by bp (on Btau4.6 in bed format ).\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'HVMRs', 'sperm', 'VMRs', 'CMRs'",
