  "sc:description": "2018 Annual Report of the American Association of Poison Control Centers' National Poison Data System (NPDS).\n\nIntroduction: This is the 36th Annual Report of the American Association of Poison Control Centers' (AAPCC) National Poison Data System (NPDS). As of 1 January, 2018, 55 of the nation's poison centers (PCs) uploaded case data automatically to NPDS. The upload interval was 7.72 [6.90, 12.0] (median [25%, 75%]) minutes, creating a near real-time national exposure and information database and surveillance system. Methods: We analyzed the case data tabulating specific indices from NPDS. The methodology was similar to that of previous years. Where changes were introduced, the differences are identified. Cases with medical outcomes of death were evaluated by a team of medical and clinical toxicologist reviewers using an ordinal scale of 1-6 to assess the Relative Contribution to Fatality (RCF) of the exposure.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'AAPCC'",
