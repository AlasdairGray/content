Its objective is the provision of a series of open file formats and open source tools for the detailed description, creation and evaluation of road surfaces. It is suitable for a broad range of applications including e.g. tyre and driving simulations.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'road', 'road surface', 'elevation'",
