  "sc:description": "a graphical user interface for the X-ray-diffraction-based determination of crystallite size distributions.\n\nBragg intensities can be used to analyse crystal size distributions in a method called FXD-CSD, which is based on the fast measurement of many Bragg spots using two-dimensional detectors. This work presents the Python-based software and its graphical user interface FXD-CSD-GUI. The GUI enables user-friendly data handling and processing and provides both graphical and numerical crystal size distribution results.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'FXD-CSD', 'Bragg', 'crystallite', 'X-ray-diffraction-based'",
