    "description": "PITRM1 (Presequence protease, mitochondrial) is an ATP-independent protease that degrades mitochondrial transit peptides after their cleavage. It is specific for peptides in the range of 10 to 65 residues and able to degrade amyloid beta A4 (APP) protein when it accumulates in mitochondrion, suggesting a link with Alzheimer's disease. PITRM1 shows a preference for cleavage after small polar residues and before basic residues, but without any positional reference.",
