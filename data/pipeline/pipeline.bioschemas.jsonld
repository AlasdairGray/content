  "sc:description": "A comprehensive RNA-Seq pipeline includes meta-analysis, interactivity and automatic reporting.\n\nThere are many methods available for each phase of the RNA-Seq analysis and each of them uses different algorithms. It is therefore useful to identify a pipeline that combines the best tools in terms of time and results. For this purpose, we compared five different pipelines, obtained by combining the most used tools in RNA-Seq analysis. Using RNA-Seq data on samples of different Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) cell lines, we compared five pipelines from the alignment to the differential expression analysis (DEA). For each one we evaluated the peak of RAM and time and then compared the differentially expressed genes identified by each pipeline.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'recurs', 'meta-analysis', 'DEA', 'HISAT2' (bio.tools/hisat2)",
