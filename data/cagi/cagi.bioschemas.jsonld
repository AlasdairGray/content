      "sc:description": "The Local Context of Cis-Regulatory Modules Complicates Prediction of Regulatory Variants.\n\nMany problems of modern genetics and functional genomics require the assessment of functional effects of sequence variants, including gene expression changes. Machine learning is considered to be a promising approach for solving this task, but its practical applications remain a challenge due to the insufficient volume and diversity of training data. A promising source of valuable data is a saturation mutagenesis massively parallel reporter assay, which quantitatively measures changes in transcription activity caused by sequence variants. Here, we explore the computational predictions of the effects of individual single-nucleotide variants on gene transcription measured in the massively parallel reporter assays, based on the data from the recent \"Regulation Saturation\" Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation challenge.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'expression-variants'",
