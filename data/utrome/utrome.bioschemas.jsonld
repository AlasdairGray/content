  "sc:description": "The C. elegans 3' UTRome v2 resource for studying mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation, 3'-UTR biology, and miRNA targeting.\n\nThe UTRome.org database is intended as a comprehensive resource for 3'UTR biology in C. elegans . The database provides detailed information on 3'UTR structures and alternative polyadenylation for all protein-coding mRNAs, and includes annotations extracted from other databases (such as WormBase and PicTar ) as well as new annotations generated by others.\n\n3'UTRs are important portions of mRNAs required for post-transcriptional regulation by interacting with proteins or non-coding RNAs (e.g. microRNAs). To study the role of 3'UTRs we are building a 3'UTR database for C. elegans .\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'UTRome v2'",
