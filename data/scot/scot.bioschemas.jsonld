  "sc:description": "Rethinking the Classification of Secondary Structure Elements.\n\nMOTIVATION:Secondary structure classification is one of the most important issues in structure-based analyses due to its impact on secondary structure prediction, structural alignment, and protein visualization. There are still open challenges concerning helix and sheet assignments which are currently not addressed by a single multi-purpose software. RESULTS:We introduce SCOT (Secondary structure Classification On Turns) as a novel secondary structure element assignment software which supports the assignment of turns, right-handed α-, 310-, and π-helices, left-handed α- and 310-helices, 2.27- and polyproline II helices, β-sheets, and kinks. We demonstrate that the introduction of helix Purity values enables a clear differentiation between helix classes. SCOT's unique strengths are highlighted by comparing it to six state-of-the-art methods (DSSP, STRIDE, ASSP, SEGNO, DISICL, and SHAFT).\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
