    "description": "Cryptosporidium is a microscopic parasite that causes the diarrheal disease cryptosporidiosis.  There are many species of Cryptosporidium that infect animals, some of which also infect humans. The parasite is protected by an outer shell that allows it to survive outside the body for long periods of time and makes it very tolerant to chlorine disinfection.",
