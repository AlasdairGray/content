      "sc:description": "an independent and graph-theory based software for visualizing the human brain connectome].\n\nAs a complex system, the topology of human's brain network has an important effect on further study of brain's structural and functional mechanism. Graph theory, a kind of sophisticated analytic strategies, is widely used for analyzing complex brain networks effectively and comparing difference of topological structure alteration in normal development and pathological condition. For the purpose of using this analysis methodology efficiently, it is necessary to develop graph-based visualization software. Thus, we developed VisConnectome, which displays analysis results of the brain network friendly and intuitively. It provides an original graphical user interface (GUI) including the tool window, tool bar and innovative double slider filter, brain region bar, runs in any Windows operating system and doesn't rely on any platform such as Matlab.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
