      "sc:description": "Computational simulations of TNF receptor oligomerization on plasma membrane.\n\nThe interactions between tumor necrosis factors (TNFs) and their corresponding receptors (TNFRs) play a pivotal role in inflammatory responses. Upon ligand binding, TNFR receptors were found to form oligomers on cell surfaces. However, the underlying mechanism of oligomerization is not fully understood. In order to tackle this problem, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been applied to the complex between TNF receptor-1 (TNFR1) and its ligand TNF-α as a specific test system. The simulations on both all-atom (AA) and coarse-grained (CG) levels achieved the similar results that the extracellular domains of TNFR1 can undergo large fluctuations on plasma membrane, while the dynamics of TNFα-TNFR1 complex is much more constrained.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE BROKEN!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'TNF', 'TNFa-TNFR1'",
