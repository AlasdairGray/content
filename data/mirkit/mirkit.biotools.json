    "description": "miRkit is an open source framework written in R, that allows for the comprehensive analysis of RT-PCR data, from the processing of raw data to a functional analysis of the produced results. The main goal of the tool is to provide an assessment of the samplesâ€™ quality, perform data normalization by endogenous and exogenous miRNAs, and facilitate differential and functional enrichment analysis. The tool offers fast execution times with low memory usage, can perform the full analysis from the raw RT-PCR data to functional analysis of targeted genes, and is specifically designed to support the popular miScript miRNA PCR Array (Qiagen) technology.",
