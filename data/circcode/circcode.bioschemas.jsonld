  "sc:description": "A Powerful Tool for Identifying circRNA Coding Ability.\n\nA Python3-base pipeline for translated circular RNA(circRNA) identification.\n\nCircCode is a Python3-base pipeline for translated circular RNA identification. It automatically tandem links sequence in series and processes a given ribosome profile data (including quality control, filtering and alignment). Finally, based on random forest and J48 classification, the final translated circular RNA was predicted. The user only needs to fill in the given configuration file and run the python scripts to get the predicted translated circular RNA",
