    "description": "Cell dissociation reagents are used to disaggregate adherent cell types from the substrate or surface to which they have become attached during culturing. LSG offers cell dissociation reagents that are both enzyme based and non-enzyme based. Non enzyme-based reagents tend to have a gentler action on the cells thereby increasing both cell viability and recovery.",
