description: 'PyMOL is a molecular graphics system targeted at medium to large biomolecules
  like proteins. It can generate high-quality publication-ready molecular graphics
  images and animations. . Features include: * Visualization of molecules, molecular
  trajectories and surfaces of crystallography data or orbitals * Molecular builder
  and sculptor * Internal raytracer and movie generator * Fully extensible and scriptable
  via a Python interface . File formats PyMOL can read include PDB, XYZ, CIF, MDL
  Molfile, ChemDraw, CCP4 maps, XPLOR maps and Gaussian cube maps.'
