      "sc:description": "A novel ensemble framework for classifying cell types based on single-cell RNA-seq data.\nThe graphical user interface version of the scASK.\n\nThe scASK is a novel and robust ensemble framework that is especially suited for cell type classification based on scRNA-seq data. Furthermore, scASK is also a generic ensemble classifier for any supervised classification problem, such as classifying cancer types based on gene expression data or DNA methylation data. scASKcmd is the command line version of scASK in a batch-processing manner, which can perform the whole process without intervention.",
