  "sc:description": "accurate supervised method for cell-type classification from single-cell RNA-seq data.\n\nscPred package for cell type prediction from scRNA-seq data.\n\nscPred: Single cell prediction using singular value decomposition and machine learning classification.\n\nscPred is a general method to predict cell types based on variance structure decomposition. It selects the most cell type-informative principal components from a dataset and trains a prediction model for each cell type. The principal training axes are projected onto the test dataset to obtain the PCs scores for the test dataset and the trained model(s) is/are used to classify single cells",
