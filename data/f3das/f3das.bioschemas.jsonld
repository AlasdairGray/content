This code includes inputs that should be changed by the user when dealing with a new problem. The user typically needs to change the \"generate_mesh.m\" file as well, to create the parametric geometries of the structure/metamaterial that is simulated by Finite Element Analysis (FEA).\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Bayesian Machine Learning Metamaterial Design', 'brittle', 'supercompressible', 'polymers'",
