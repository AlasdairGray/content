      "sc:description": "Refinement, reliability and validity of the Time Capture Tool (TimeCaT) using the Omaha System to support data capture for time motion studies.\n\nThe intrinsic variability of clinical workflow demands a representative sampling and scheduling of observations. TimeCaT facilitates this with an observations scheduling module.\n\nThe Touch-timestamp feature allows observers to redirect their attention to the environment being studied. Additionally, the capability to correct data during the observation ensures clean data for the principal investigator.\n\nOur novel 3-dimensional approach to capturing multi-tasking provides an easy, accurate and reliable means for recording real-world complex multi tasking scenarios",
