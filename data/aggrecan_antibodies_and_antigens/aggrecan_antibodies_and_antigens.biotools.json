    "description": "Aggrecan is a high molecular weight proteoglycan produced by chondrocytes and the production of which is regulated by cytokines and growth factors such as IL1\u00df, TNFa, IGF1 or TGF\u00df. Aggrecan is the major proteoglycan of the articular cartilage. It fills the interstices of the collagen meshwork by forming large aggregated complexes interacting with hyaluronan and link proteins.",
