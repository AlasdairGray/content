      "sc:description": "Design and Evaluation of a Cochlear Implant and Hearing Aid Research Platform for Speech Scientists and Engineers.\n\nHearing loss is an increasingly prevalent condition resulting from damage to the inner ear which causes a reduction in speech intelligibility. The societal need for assistive hearing devices has increased exponentially over the past two decades; however, actual human performance with such devices has only seen modest gains relative to advancements in digital signal processing (DSP) technology. A major challenge with clinical hearing technologies is the limited ability to run complex signal processing algorithms requiring high computation power.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'UT-Dallas', 'speech', 'hearing', 'software-mediated'",
