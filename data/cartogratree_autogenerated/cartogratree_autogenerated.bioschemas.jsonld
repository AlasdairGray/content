      "sc:description": "Enabling landscape genomics for forest trees.\n\nForest trees cover just over 30% of the earth's surface and are studied by researchers around the world for both their conservation and economic value. With the onset of high throughput technologies, tremendous phenotypic and genomic data sets have been generated for hundreds of species. These long-lived and immobile individuals serve as ideal models to assess population structure and adaptation to environment. Despite the availability of comprehensive data, researchers are challenged to integrate genotype, phenotype, and environment in one place. Towards this goal, CartograTree was designed and implemented as an open repository and open-source analytic framework for genomic, phenotypic, and environmental data for forest trees.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| NAME EQUAL TO (PUB.
