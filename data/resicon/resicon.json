Identification and analysis of intramolecular motions is a complex problem. Breaking a structure into relatively rigid parts, the so-called dynamic domains, may help comprehend the complexity of protein's mobility. We propose a new approach called ResiCon (Residue Contacts analysis), which performs this task by applying a data-mining analysis of an ensemble of protein configurations and recognizes dynamic domains, hinges and interfacial regions, by considering contacts between residues. Results: Dynamic domains found by ResiCon are more compact than those identified by two other popular methods: PiSQRD and GeoStaS. The current analysis was carried out using a known reference set of 30 NMR protein structures, as well as molecular dynamics simulation data of flap opening events in HIV-1 protease. The more detailed analysis of HIV-1 protease dataset shows that ResiCon identified dynamic domains involved in structural changes of functional importance. Availability and implementation: The ResiCon server is available at URL: http://dworkowa.imdik.pan.pl/EP/ResiCon.",
