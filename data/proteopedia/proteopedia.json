Created as a means for communicating biomolecule structures to a diverse scientific audience, Proteopedia (http://www.proteopedia.org) presents structural annotation in an intuitive, interactive format and allows members of the scientific community to easily contribute their own annotations. Here, we provide a status report on Proteopedia by describing advances in the web resource since its inception three and a half years ago, focusing on features of potential direct use to the scientific community. We discuss its progress as a collaborative 3D-encyclopedia of structures as well as its use as a complement to scientific publications and PowerPoint presentations. We also describe Proteopedia's use for 3D visualization in structure-related pedagogy. Â© 2011 Elsevier Inc.",
