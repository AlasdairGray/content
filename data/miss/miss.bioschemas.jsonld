  "sc:description": "A novel pipeline for quantitative mapping of diverse cell types across the murine brain.\n\nABSTRACT The advent of increasingly sophisticated imaging platforms has allowed for the visualization of the murine nervous system at single-cell resolution. However, current cell counting methods compromise on either the ability to map a large number of different cell types, or spatial coverage, and therefore whole-brain quantification of finely resolved neural cell subtypes remains elusive. Here we present a comprehensive and novel computational pipeline called Matrix Inversion and Subset Selection (MISS) that aims to fill this gap in knowledge and has the ability to infer counts of diverse collections of neural cell types at sub-millimeter resolution using a combination of single-cell RNAseq and in situ hybridization datasets.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
