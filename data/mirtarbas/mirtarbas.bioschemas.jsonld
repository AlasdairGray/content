  "sc:description": "Identification of key genes and long non-coding RNA associated ceRNA networks in hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\nthe experimentally validated microRNA-target interactions database.\n\nAs a database, miRTarBase has accumulated more than three hundred and sixty thousand miRNA-target interactions (MTIs), which are collected by manually surveying pertinent literature after NLP of the text systematically to filter research articles related to functional studies of miRNAs. Generally, the collected MTIs are validated experimentally by reporter assay, western blot, microarray and next-generation sequencing experiments. While containing the largest amount of validated MTIs, the miRTarBase provides the most updated collection by comparing with other similar, previously developed databases.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'UALCAN' (bio.tools/UALCAN), 'miRcode', 'EnrichNet' (bio.tools/enrichnet), 'miRDB' (bio.tools/miRDB)",
