  long_description: " The GATB-CORE project provides a set of highly efficient\n algorithms\
    \ to analyse NGS data sets. These methods enable\n the analysis of data sets of\
    \ any size on multi-core desktop\n computers, including very huge amount of reads\
    \ data coming\n from any kind of organisms such as bacteria, plants,\n animals\
    \ and even complex samples (e.g. metagenomes).\n Read more about GATB at https://gatb.inria.fr/.\n\
    \ By itself GATB-CORE is not an NGS data analysis tool.\n However, it can be used\
    \ to create such tools. There already\n exist a set of ready-to-use tools relying\
    \ on GATB-CORE\n library: see https://gatb.inria.fr/software/\n .\n This package\
    \ contains the static library and the header files\n of the gatb-core library.\n"
