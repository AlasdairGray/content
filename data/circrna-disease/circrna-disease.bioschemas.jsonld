The method first fuses multi-source information including disease semantic similarity, disease Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity, and circRNA Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity, and then extracts its hidden deep feature through the convolutional neural network, and finally sends them to the extreme learning machine classifier for prediction.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'CircRNA-disease Associations Using Deep Convoltional', 'CircRNA-disease Associations Using', 'CircRNA-disease Associations Using Deep', 'circRNA-disease associations'",
