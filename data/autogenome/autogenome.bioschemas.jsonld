  "sc:description": "An AutoML Tool for Genomic Research.\n\nAbstract Deep learning have made great successes in traditional fields like computer vision (CV), natural language processing (NLP) and speech processing. Those achievements greatly inspire researchers in genomic study and make deep learning in genomics a very hot topic. Convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) are frequently used for genomic sequence prediction problems; multiple layer perception (MLP) and auto-encoders (AE) are frequently used for genomic profiling data like RNA expression data and gene mutation data. Here, we introduce a new neural network architecture, named residual fully-connected neural network (RFCN) and demonstrate its advantage for modeling genomic profiling data. We further incorporate AutoML algorithms and implement AutoGenome, an end-to-end automated genomic deep learning framework.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'RFCN'",
