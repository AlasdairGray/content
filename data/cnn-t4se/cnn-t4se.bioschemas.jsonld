It is used to identify effector proteins through the amino acid sequence, evolutionary information in the form of a position-specific scoring matrix, secondary structure and solvent accessibility information of the proteins. The following steps will help you to use CNN-T4SE to identify effectors.\n\nSTEP-1: Prepare the input files of different prediction methods",
