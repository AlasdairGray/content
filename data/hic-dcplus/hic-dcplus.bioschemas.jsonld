HiC-DC+ integrates with popular preprocessing and visualization tools, includes TAD and A B compartment callers, and outperformed existing tools in H3K27ac HiChIP benchmarking as validated by CRISPRi-FlowFISH. Differential HiC-DC+ analysis recovered global principles of 3D organization during cohesin perturbation and differentiation, including TAD aggregation, enhancer hubs, and promoter-enhancer loop dynamics",
