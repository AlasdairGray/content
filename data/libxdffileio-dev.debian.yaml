  description: Library to read/write EEG data file formats (development files)
  long_description: " xdffileio is a library that provides a unified interface for\
    \ writing and\n reading various biosignal file formats in realtime (i.e. streaming).\
    \ It has\n been designed to provide a flexible, consistent and generic interface\
    \ to\n all supported file formats while minimizing the overhead the function\n\
    \ calls: the heaviest operations (type casting, scaling and formatting) are\n\
    \ offloaded into a separated thread. This design makes its particularly\n suitable\
    \ to be directly used in a data acquisition loop (like in\n electrophysiology\
    \ recording or in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI)).\n .\n The genericity of the\
    \ interface makes trivial various operations like\n transformation of a recorded\
    \ file or its conversion to another file format.\n xdffileio currently supports\
    \ EDF, BDF, GDF1 and GDF2 file formats and more\n will be added in future.\n .\n\
    \ This package contains the files needed to compile and link programs which\n\
    \ use xdffileio.\n"
