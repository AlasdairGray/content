  "sc:description": "The Case for Sensible Extraction of Interactions in the Era of Machine Learning.\n\nExtract meaningful interactions from machine learning models to obtain machine-learning performance with statistical model interpretability.\n\nWelcome to InteractionTransformer.\n\nWelcome to the InteractionTransformer wiki!.\n\nWhat our package does not do: extract transformations in the data to add them to the design matrix. For those capabilities, please see the SAFE Transformer package (https://github.com/ModelOriented/SAFE). Our package does have an experimental feature that will iteratively call InteractionTransformer and SAFETransformer to develop multi-layer interactions/transformation models, but this is still under development.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Don t Dismiss Logistic Regression'",
