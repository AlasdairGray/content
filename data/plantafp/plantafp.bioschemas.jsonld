      "sc:description": "a curated database of plant-origin antifungal peptides.\n\nEmerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are a severe problem caused by fungi in human and plant species across the world. They pose a worldwide threat to food security as well as human health. Fungal infections are increasing now day by day worldwide, and the current antimycotic drugs are not effective due to the emergence of resistant strains. Therefore, it is an urgent need for the finding of new plant-origin antifungal peptides (PhytoAFPs). Huge numbers of peptides were extracted from different plant species which play a protective role against fungal infection. Hundreds of plant-origin peptides with antifungal activity have already been reported. So there is a requirement of a dedicated platform which systematically catalogs plant-origin peptides along with their antifungal properties.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE BROKEN!",
