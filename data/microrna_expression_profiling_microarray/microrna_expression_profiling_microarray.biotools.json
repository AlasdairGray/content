    "description": "\"CD Genomics offers a comprehensive microRNA microarray profiling service based on some of the most powerful platforms in this field with unrivaled accuracy and sensitivity.\nmiRNA expression profiling came into prominence, in part, because of the expectation that a highly expressed miRNA for a given tissue or cell type (or a developmental stage) is likely to play a regulatory role.Let microRNA and microarray experts perform your analysis in automated laboratories with rigorous quality control and fast turn-around times and advanced data analysis tailored to your research needs and budget.\"",
