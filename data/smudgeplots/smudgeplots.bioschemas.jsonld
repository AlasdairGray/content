  "sc:description": "Reference-free profiling of polyploid genomes | Inference of ploidy and heterozygosity structure using whole genome sequencing data | Smudgeplots are computed from raw or even better from trimmed reads and show the haplotype structure using heterozygous kmer pairs. For example: | This tool extracts heterozygous kmer pairs from kmer dump files and performs gymnastics with them. We are able to disentangle genome structure by comparing the sum of kmer pair coverages (CovA + CovB) to their relative coverage (CovA / (CovA + CovB)). Such an approach also allows us to analyze obscure genomes with duplications, various ploidy levels, etc | GenomeScope 2.0 and Smudgeplots: Reference-free profiling of polyploid genomes Timothy Rhyker Ranallo-Benavidez, Kamil S.
