NOVEL AD-REIC VECTOR WITH THE SUPER GENE EXPRESSION (SGE) SYSTEM (AD-SGE-REIC) AS A PROMISING THERAPEUTIC AGENT FOR MALIGNANT GLIOMA.\n\nAbstractINTRODUCTIONReduced expression in immortalized cells Dickkopf-3 (REIC Dkk-3) is a tumor suppressor and therapeutic gene in many human cancers. We have investigated the anti-glioma effect of the adenovirus vector carrying REIC Dkk-3 (Ad-CAG-REIC). Recently an Ad-REIC vector with the super gene expression (SGE) system (Ad-SGE-REIC) has been developed for higher protein expression and therapeutic effects than the conventional adenoviral vector (Ad-CAG-REIC). In this study, we evaluated the anti-glioma effect of the Ad-SGE-REIC against malignant glioma.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE BROKEN!.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/Diffeomorphic (IC.OUP.COM).\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Ad-CAG-REIC', 'REIC', 'Ad-SGE-REIC Ad-CAG-REIC Ad-LacZ', 'Ad-REIC'",
