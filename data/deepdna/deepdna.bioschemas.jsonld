  "sc:description": "Human mitochondrial genome compression using machine learning techniques.\n\na hybrid convolutional and recurrent neural network for compressing compression human mitochondrial genomes.\n\ndeepDNA, a novel unified model called deepDNA that combines the convolutional neural network (CNN) with the long short-term memory network (LSTM) for compressing human mitochondrial genome sequences. The experiment has shown that out method deepDNA is able to learn sequence local features through a convolutional layer, and to learn higher level representations of long-term sequences dependencies through a long short-term memory network (LSTM) layer. We evaluated the learned genome sequences representations model on human mitochondrial genome sequences compressing tasks and achieved a satisfactory result.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'DeepDNA available'",
