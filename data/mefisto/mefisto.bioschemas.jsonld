      "sc:description": "Identifying temporal and spatial patterns of variation from multi-modal data using MEFISTO.\n\nThis repository contains application of MEFISTO to simulated and multi-modal omics data:.\n\n\n\nMEFISTO provides an unsupervised approach to integrate multi-modal data with continuous structures among the samples, e.g. given by spatial or temporal relationships. The aim of MEFISTO is to exploit such relationships between samples in the dimensionality reduction and disentangle smooth sources of variation given by factors that change gradually along the covariate and other source of variation that are independent of the covariate. Furthermore, it enables to interpolate/extrapolate to unseen timepoints or locations.",
