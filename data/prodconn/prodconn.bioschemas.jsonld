  "sc:description": "Protein Design using a Convolutional Neural Network.\n\nDesigning protein sequences that fold to a given three-dimensional structure has long been a challenging problem in computational structural biology with significant theoretical and practical implications. In this study, we first formulated this problem as predicting the residue type given the three-dimensional structural environment around the CÎ± atom of a residue, which is repeated for each residue of a protein. We designed a nine-layer three-dimensional deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that takes as input a gridded box with the atomic coordinates and types around a residue. Several CNN layers were designed to capture structure information at different scales, such as bond lengths, bond angles, torsion angles, and secondary structures.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
