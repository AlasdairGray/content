    "description": "Recombinant rabbit Factor XIII is a homodimer (a2) composed by two chains held together by non-covalent bonds. It is N-terminally fused to a hexahistidine-tag. After activation of the zymogen by Thrombin and Ca2+ to its active form (a*2, Factor XIIIa), Factor XIIIa catalyzes the formation of covalent bridges (\u03b5-(\u03b3-glutamyl) lysine bonds) between fibrin units to increase the elasticity of the clot network. The resulting cross-linked fibrin is insoluble and resistant to lysis.",
