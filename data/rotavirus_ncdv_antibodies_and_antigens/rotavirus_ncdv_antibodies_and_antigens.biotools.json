    "description": "Rotaviruses, members of the family Reoviridae, are a major cause of diarrhoea in young mammals. Rotavirus infections also result in economic losses in agriculture due to diarrhoea in calf, pig, sheep, and poultry rearing. Nebraska Calf Diarrhea Virus (NCVD) can affect calves up to 30 days of age or older. Diarrhoea begins 2 to 3 days after exposure. Diagnosis is by history, lesions (ulcers on the tongue, lips, and mouth) and diagnostic laboratory tests.",
