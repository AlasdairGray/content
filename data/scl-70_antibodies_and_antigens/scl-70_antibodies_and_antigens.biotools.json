    "description": "DNA topoisomerase I is a key nuclear and nucleolar enzyme that interconverts supercoiled DNA to the topological conformations required for DNA replication and transcription. In human tissues, DNA topoisomerase I is initially synthesized as a protein with a molecular weight of 100 kDa. Most of this precursor is the  proteolytically processed to a 70 kDa form.",
