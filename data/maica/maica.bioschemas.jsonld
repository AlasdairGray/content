The idea behind the method (called moving average ICA or MAICA) is to extend the original low-sensor matrix of signals by applying a set of zero-phase moving average filters to each of the recorded signals. APPROACH:The paper discusses the theoretical background of the MAICA algorithm and verifies its usefulness under three exemplary settings: (i) a pure mathematic system composed of ten source sinusoids; (ii) real EEG data recorded from 64 channels; (iii) real EEG data recorded from five subjects during 200 trials with motor imagery brain-computer interface",
