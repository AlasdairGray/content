      "sc:description": "Parallel Architecture and Hardware Accelerator Design for BLAST-based Protein Sequence Alignment.\n\nIn this study, we design a hardware accelerator for a widely used sequence alignment algorithm, the basic local alignment search tool for proteins (BLASTP). The architecture of the proposed accelerator consists of five stages: a new systolic-array-based one-hit finding stage, a novel RAM-REG-based two-hit finding stage, a refined ungapped extension stage, a faster gapped extension stage, and a highly efficient parallel sorter. The system is implemented on an Altera Stratix V FPGA with a processing speed of more than 500 giga cell updates per second (GCUPS). It can receive a query sequence, compare it with the sequences in the database, and generate a list sorted in descending order of the similarity scores between the query sequence and the subject sequences.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'accelerator', 'Altera', 'Stratix', 'RAM-REG-based'",
