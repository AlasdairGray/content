  "sc:description": "The global Edoxaban Treatment in routine cliNical prActice (ETNA) noninterventional study program.\n\nBACKGROUND:Randomized controlled trials showed the nonvitamin K oral anticoagulant (NOAC) edoxaban was effective and safe for stroke and systemic embolism prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) and for the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE; including pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis). Additional research is needed to evaluate the effects of edoxaban in routine clinical practice. Therefore, the Edoxaban Treatment in routine cliNical prActice (ETNA) program is being conducted to provide routine clinical care data on characteristics and outcomes in patients with AF or VTE receiving edoxaban.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
