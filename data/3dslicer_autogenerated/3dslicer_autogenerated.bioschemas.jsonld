      "sc:description": "In-House Surgeon-Led Virtual Surgical Planning for Maxillofacial Reconstruction.\n\nPURPOSE:Virtual surgical planning (VSP) and custom fabricated cutting guides for maxillofacial reconstruction have been shown to improve the accuracy of bony reconstruction and overall surgical efficiency and decrease the ischemia time. Our aim was to describe an in-house VSP technique for maxillofacial reconstructive procedures. MATERIALS AND METHODS:We used 2 free software applications. 3DSlicer (available at: http: www. 3dslicer.org) was used to extract the bones of interest for the recipient and the donor sites from the computed tomography scan's DICOM (digital imaging and communications in medicine) data. The Autodesk Meshmixer (Autodesk Inc, San Rafael, CA) was used to perform VSP and fabrication of the cutting guides.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE BROKEN!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'VSP', 'in-house VSP', 'maxillofacial'",
