      "sc:description": "A Tool for Anti-Cancer and Antimicrobial Peptide Generation.\n\nAnti-cancer peptides (ACPs) play a vital role in the cell signaling process. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) provide immunity against pathogenic microbes, AMPs present activity against pathogenic microbes. Some of them are known to possess both anticancer and antimicrobial activity. However, so far, no tools have been developed that could predict potential ACPs from wild and mutated cancerous protein sequences in the numerous public databases. In the present study, we developed a A-CaMP tool that allows rapid fingerprinting of the anti-cancer and antimicrobial peptides, which play a crucial role in current bioinformatics research. Besides, we compared the performance and functionality of our A-CaMP tool with those of other methods available online. A-CaMP scans the target protein sequences provided by the user against the datasets.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE BROKEN!",
