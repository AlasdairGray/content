Published by Wiley-VCH GmbHThe analysis of B-factor profiles from X-ray protein structures can be utilized for structure-based drug design since protein mobility changes have been associated with the quality of protein-ligand interactions. With the BAN\u0394IT (B\u2019-factor analysis and \u0394B\u2019 interpretation toolkit), we have developed a JavaScript-based browser application that provides a graphical user interface for the normalization and analysis of B\u2019-factor profiles. To emphasize the usability for rational drug design applications, we have analyzed a selection of crystallographic protein-ligand complexes and have given exemplary conclusions for further drug optimization including the development of a B\u2019-factor-supported pharmacophore model for SARS CoV-2 main protease inhibitors. BAN\u0394IT is available online at https://bandit.uni-mainz.de. The source code can be downloaded from https://github.com/FBarthels/BANDIT.",
