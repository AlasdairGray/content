    "description": "Creative Enzymes is well known for all enzyme studies and provides quality services to support lab research as well as industrial production. Enzymes catalyze all kinds of chemical reactions with high specificity and efficiency. In most cases, enzymes employ cofactors, which are also known as coenzymes or prosthetic groups, to facilitate binding and interacting with the substrate. Therefore, it is important and necessary to study mechanisms in catalytic process.",
