  "sc:description": "Labelling chest x-ray reports using an open-source NLP and ML tool for text data binary classification.\n\nNatural language processing and machine learning of a comma separated value (CSV) file with text data and labels.\n\nnlp_ml is a command line script that performs natural language processing and machine learning of a CSV (comma separated value) file with text data and labels. The CSV file must have the columns 'text' and 'class'. The code randomly generates classification pipelines, performs 10-fold cross validation for assessing model performance on the training dataset, and saves the results to a SQLite database. The code uses the SMOTE oversampler to avoid issues with imbalanced datasets. nlp_ml solves supervised binary classification problems using text data. When generating your CSV file, replace commas with spaces in the elements of the text column prior to saving the file.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'NLP', 'chest', 'endotracheal', 'Inpatient'",
