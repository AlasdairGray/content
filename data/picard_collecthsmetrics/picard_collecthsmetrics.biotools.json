    "description": "Collects hybrid-selection (HS) metrics for a SAM or BAM file.\n\nThis tool takes a SAM/BAM file input and collects metrics that are specific for sequence datasets generated through hybrid-selection. Hybrid-selection (HS) is the most commonly used technique to capture exon-specific sequences for targeted sequencing experiments such as exome sequencing; for more information, please see the corresponding GATK Dictionary entry.",
