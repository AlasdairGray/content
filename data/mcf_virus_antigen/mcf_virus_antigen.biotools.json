    "description": "Rhadinoviruses are a genus of herpesviruses that include the Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), also known as Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), which causes Kaposi's sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma and multicentric Castleman's disease. Other names for the Rhadinovirus genus include Rhadinoviridae and gamma-2 herpesviruses. The term rhadino comes from the Latin fragile, referring to the tendency of the viral genome to break apart when it is isolated. They are large double-stranded viruses that possess up to 100 genes in a single long chromosome, which is flanked by repetitive DNA sequences called terminal repeats. In general, rhadinoviruses infect lymphocytes and adherent cells.",
