      "sc:description": "a conserved RNA structure that controls Tat expression and acts as a switch for HIV productive and latent infection.\n\nTat protein is essential to fully activate HIV transcription and processing of viral mRNA, and therefore determines virus expression in productive replication and the establishment and maintenance of latent infection. Here, we used thermodynamic and structure analyses to define a highly conserved sequence-structure in tat mRNA that functions as Tat IRES modulator of tat mRNA (TIM-TAM). By impeding cap-dependent ribosome progression during authentic spliced tat mRNA translation, TIM-TAM stable structure impacts on timing and level of Tat protein hence controlling HIV production and infectivity along with promoting latency.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Tat IRES modulator tat mRNA'",
