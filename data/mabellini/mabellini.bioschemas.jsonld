  "sc:description": "a genome-wide database for understanding the structural proteome and evaluating prospective antimicrobial targets of the emerging pathogen Mycobacterium abscessus.\n\nAn on-line source for Mycobacterium abscessus modeled structural proteome.\n\nMabeLLINI (Mycobacterium ABscessus modELLing INItiative) is a database available to anyone that wishes to know in detail the structural proteome of Mycobacterium abscessus. It contains thousands of models, generated with an unique domain-based methodology and thoroughly annotated with information from UniProt, CATH, SCOP and many more resources. These models are readily available for download, either individually or in bundles. To access them, simply use one of the many available queries or explore the data using our hierarchical interactive sunbursts",
