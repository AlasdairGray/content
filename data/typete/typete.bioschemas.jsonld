  "sc:description": "a tool to genotype mobile element insertions from whole genome resequencing data.\n\nGenotyping of segregating mobile elements insertions.\n\nThis pipeline is developped by Jainy Thomas (University of Utah) and Clement Goubert (Cornell University). Elaborated with the collaboration of Jeffrey M. Kidd (University of Michigan).\n\nTypeTE is a pipeline dedicated to genotype segregating Mobile Element Insertion (MEI) previously scored with a MEI detection tool such as MELT (Mobile Element Locator Tool, Gardner et al., 2017).\n\nPlease adress all you questions and comments using the \"issue\" tab of the repository",
