  long_description: " To integrate with the pbsmrtpipe workflow engine, one must to\
    \ be able to\n generate a Tool Contract and to be able to run from a Resolved\
    \ Tool Contract.\n A Tool Contract contains the metadata of the exe, such as the\
    \ file types of\n inputs, outputs and options.\n There are two principal use cases,\
    \ first wrapping/calling Python functions that\n have been defined in external\
    \ Python 3 packages, or scripts. Second, creating a\n CLI tool that supports emitting\
    \ tool contracts, running resolved tool contracts\n and complete argparse-style\
    \ CLI.\n"
