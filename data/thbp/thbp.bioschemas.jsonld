  "sc:description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'NEN', 'Wikipedia', 'discharge', 'anatomical' | Mapping anatomical related entities to human body parts based on wikipedia in discharge summaries | *: Background Consisting of dictated free-text documents such as discharge summaries, medical narratives are widely used in medical natural language processing. Relationships between anatomical entities and human body parts are crucial for building medical text mining applications. To achieve this, we establish a mapping system consisting of a Wikipedia-based scoring algorithm and a named entity normalization method (NEN). The mapping system makes full use of information available on Wikipedia, which is a comprehensive Internet medical knowledge base",
