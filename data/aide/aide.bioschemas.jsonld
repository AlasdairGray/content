  "sc:description": "annotation-assisted isoform discovery with high precision.\n\nAIDE: annotation-assisted isoform discovery and quantification from RNA-seq data.\n\nAIDE is a statistical method which identifies full-length mRNA isoforms from a novel perspective: using the likelihood ratio test to find novel isoforms in a stepwise manner given annotated isoforms, by prioritizing and selectively borrowing information from the annotated isoforms. Please refer to our preprint at Biorxiv for detailed description of our method",
