    "description": "The Transferpettor DE-M Fixed Positive-displacement Pipette, 200 \u00b5L, BRAND is the ideal choice for your liquid when air displacement pipette does not work. This product can handle sticky, foam, high steam pressure and other liquids with high accuracy and accuracy. This is your most demanding pipette. This product works according to the principle of positive displacement. Compared with the air displacement pipette, the piston contacts the liquid directly. The closely fitted piston always cleans the wall of the tip until the last drop. So provide repeatable results. There is no need to discard the needle after each pipette operation because the residual wetting is negligible.",
