  "sc:description": "> HOMEPAGE MISSING! | a visualization tool for rapid detection of bacterial strain clusters based on optimized multidimensional scaling | With the evolution of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, whole-genome sequencing of bacterial isolates is increasingly employed to investigate epidemiology. Phylogenetic analysis is the common method for using NGS data, usually for comparing closeness between bacterial isolates to detect probable outbreaks. However, interpreting a phylogenetic tree is not easy without training in evolutionary biology. Therefore, developing an easy-to-use tool that can assist people who wish to use a phylogenetic tree to investigate epidemiological relatedness is crucial",
