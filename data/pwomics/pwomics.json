    "description": "This tool performs pathway-based level-specific data comparison of matching omics data sets based on pre-analysed user-specified lists of differential genes/transcripts and proteins. A separate downstream analysis of proteomic data including pathway identification and enrichment analysis, TF identification and target gene identification is opposed to the upstream analysis starting with gene or transcript information as basis for identification of upstream TF and regulators.",

Here we present a straightforward approach for the integrative analysis of data from different high-throughput technologies based on pathway and interaction models from public databases. pwOmics performs pathway-based level-specific data comparison of coupled human proteomic and genomic/transcriptomic datasets based on their log fold changes. Separate downstream and upstream analyses results on the functional levels of pathways, transcription factors and genes/transcripts are performed in the cross-platform consensus analysis. These provide a basis for the combined interpretation of regulatory effects over time. Via network reconstruction and inference methods (Steiner tree, dynamic Bayesian network inference) consensus graphical networks can be generated for further analyses and visualization.",
