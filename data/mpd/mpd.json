                "abstract": "The Mouse Phenome Project was launched a decade ago to complement mouse genome sequencing efforts by promoting new phenotyping initiatives under standardized conditions and collecting the data in a central public database, the Mouse Phenome Database (MPD; http://phenome .jax.org). MPD houses a wealth of strain characteristics data to facilitate the use of the laboratory mouse in translational research for human health and disease, helping alleviate problems involving experimentation in humans that cannot be done practically or ethically. Data sets are voluntarily contributed by researchers from a variety of institutions and settings, or in some cases, retrieved by MPD staff from public sources. MPD maintains a growing collection of standardized reference data that assists investigators in selecting mouse strains for research applications; houses treatment/control data for drug studies and other interventions; offers a standardized platform for discovering genotype-phenotype relationships; and provides tools for hypothesis testing. MPD improvements and updates since our last NAR report are presented, including the addition of new tools and features to facilitate navigation and data mining as well as the acquisition of new data (phenotypic, genotypic and gene expression).
