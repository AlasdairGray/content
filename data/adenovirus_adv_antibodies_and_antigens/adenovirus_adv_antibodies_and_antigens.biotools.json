    "description": "Adenoviruses (members of the family Adenoviridae) are medium-sized (90\u2013100 nm), nonenveloped (without an outer lipid bilayer) viruses with an icosahedral nucleocapsid containing a double stranded DNA genome. They have a broad range of vertebrate hosts. Their name derives from their initial isolation from human adenoids in 1953.",
