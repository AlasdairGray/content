It comprises of a powerful groundwater hydrograph time-series modelling and simulation framework plus a data quality analysis module. Multiple models can be built for one bore, allowing statistical identification of the dominant processes, or 100â€™s of bores can be modelled to quantify aquifer heterogeneity. This flexibility allows many novel applications such as:.\n\nHosted directly from your GitHub repository.
