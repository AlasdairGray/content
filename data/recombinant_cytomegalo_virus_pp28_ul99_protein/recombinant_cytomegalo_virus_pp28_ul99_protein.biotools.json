    "description": "The human cytomegalovirus UL99-encoded pp28 is a myristylated phosphoprotein that is a constituent of the virion. The pp28 protein is positioned within the tegument of the virus particle, a protein structure that resides between the capsid and envelope. In the infected cell, pp28 is found in a cytoplasmic compartment derived from the Golgi apparatus, where the virus buds into vesicles to acquire its final membrane. Cytomegalovirus (from the Greek cyto-, \"cell\", and -megalo-, \"large\") is a viral genus of the viral family known as Herpesviridae or herpesviruses. It is typically abbreviated as CMV.",
