It is challenging to define a single perfect metric that covers all quality aspects. Here, we distinguish here between impact and influence and discuss measures and mentions as the basis of quality metrics of a digital repository. We argue that these challenges may potentially be overcome through the introduction of standard resource identification and data citation practices. We briefly summarize our research and experience in the Neuroscience Information Framework, the BD2K BioCaddie project on data citation, and the Resource Identification Initiative.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE BROKEN!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'BD2K', 'publishers'",
