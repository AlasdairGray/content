    "description": "The tumor marker CA72-4 (Cancer antigen 72-4), also known as Tumor-associated glycoprotein (TAG) 72, is a mucin-like protein of high molecular weight (200- 400 kD). The value of CA 72-4 in serum and plasma lies in between 0-7 U/ml in normal individuals. A higher value may indicate the presence of cancer and require further investigations. Studies revealed that there is a good correlation between CA 72-4 levels and tumor stage and size, and significantly high levels of CA 72-4 normally indicate recurrent disease.",
