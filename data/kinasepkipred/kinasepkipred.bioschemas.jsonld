We used the data points that were specifically represent Ki values to train and test the models.\n\nDownload the docker image docker pull sirimullalab/kinasepkipred:py2.\n\nRun the container docker run --rm sirimullalab/kinasepkipred:py2 <protein_sequence> <compound_smiles>. To run with a built-in sample, do docker run --rm sirimullalab/kinasepkipred:py2.\n\nSet up the conda environment and activate it.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'pKi', 'pK i'",
