Development of a Novel Application for Differential Diagnosis of Tick-borne Diseases.\n\nAbstractBackgroundEarly diagnosis and treatment of tick-borne diseases (TBDs) is critical for mitigating their adverse health outcomes, but the differential diagnosis of TBDs is challenging because many symptoms are nonspecific and commonly used diagnostic assays have significant shortcomings. Furthermore, although the local incidence of TBDs is recognized as an important factor in diagnosis, tools to help clinicians formally consider surveillance data in their decision-making are not available. To address these gaps, Gryphon Scientific developed a differential diagnosis application (app) for TBDs that calculates a patientâ€™s likelihood of infection with specific TBDs based on their symptoms, risk factors, and state of suspected tick exposure.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'TBDs', 'BBN', 'TBD', 'diagnosis'",
