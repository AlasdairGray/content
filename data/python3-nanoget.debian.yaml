  description: extract information from Oxford Nanopore sequencing data and alignments
  long_description: " The Python3 module nanoget provides functions to extract useful\
    \ metrics\n from Oxford Nanopore sequencing reads and alignments.\n .\n Data can\
    \ be presented in the following formats, using the following functions:\n .\n\
    \  * sorted bam file process_bam(bamfile, threads)\n  * standard fastq file process_fastq_plain(fastqfile,\
    \ 'threads')\n  * fastq file with metadata from MinKNOW or Albacore\n    process_fastq_rich(fastqfile)\n\
    \  * sequencing_summary file generated by Albacore\n    process_summary(sequencing_summary.txt,\
    \ 'readtype')\n .\n Fastq files can be compressed using gzip, bzip2 or bgzip.\
    \ The data is\n returned as a pandas DataFrame with standardized headernames for\n\
    \ convenient extraction. The functions perform logging while being called\n and\
    \ extracting data.\n"
