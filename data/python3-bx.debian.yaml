  description: library to manage genomic data and its alignment
  long_description: " The bx-python project is a Python3 library and associated set\
    \ of scripts to\n allow for rapid implementation of genome scale analyses. The\
    \ library contains\n a variety of useful modules, but the particular strengths\
    \ are:\n  * Classes for reading and working with genome-scale multiple local\n\
    \    alignments (in MAF, AXT, and LAV formats)\n  * Generic data structure for\
    \ indexing on disk files that contain blocks of\n    data associated with intervals\
    \ on various sequences (used, for example, to\n    provide random access to individual\
    \ alignments in huge files; optimized\n    for use over network filesystems)\n\
    \  * Data structures for working with intervals on sequences\n  * \"Binned bitsets\"\
    \ which act just like chromosome sized bit arrays, but\n    lazily allocate regions\
    \ and allow large blocks of all set or all unset\n    bits to be stored compactly\n\
    \  * \"Intersecter\" for performing fast intersection tests that preserve both\n\
    \    query and target intervals and associated annotation\n"
