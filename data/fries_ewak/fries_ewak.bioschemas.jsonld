      "sc:description": "Novel, provable algorithms for efficient ensemble-based computational protein design and their application to the redesign of the c-Raf-RBD:KRas protein-protein interface.\n\nAbstract The K * algorithm provably approximates partition functions for a set of states (e.g., protein, ligand, and protein-ligand complex) to a user-specified accuracy ε. Often, reaching an ε -approximation for a particular set of partition functions takes a prohibitive amount of time and space. To alleviate some of this cost, we introduce two algorithms into the osprey suite for protein design: fries , a Fast Removal of Inadequately Energied Sequences, and EWAK *, an Energy Window Approximation to K *.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'osprey', 'c-Raf-RBD c-Raf-RBD(RKY fries EWAK osprey', 'c-Raf-RBD c-Raf-RBD(RKY fries EWAK', 'EWAK'",
