  "sc:description": "a web database providing comprehensive information on Japanese pear transcriptome.\n\nJapanese pear (Pyrus pyrifolia) is a major fruit tree in the family Rosaceae and is bred for fruit production. To promote the development of breeding strategies and molecular research for Japanese pear, we sequenced the transcripts of Japanese pear variety 'Hosui'. To exhaustively collect information of total gene expression, RNA samples from various organs and stages of Japanese pear were sequenced by three technologies, single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing, 454 pyrosequencing, and Sanger sequencing. Using all those reads, we determined comprehensive reference sequences of Japanese pear. Then, their protein sequences were predicted, and biological functional annotations were assigned.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Japanese pear', 'nashi', 'Rosaceae'",
