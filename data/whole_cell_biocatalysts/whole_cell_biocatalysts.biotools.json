    "description": "For many biocatalytic processes, purified enzymes are the core of the machinery. Purification of enzymes is usually time-consuming and costly. Furthermore, enzymes usually require additional processing such as immobilization to improve the activity or stability. Different immobilization strategies need to be evaluated to determine the best solution.",
