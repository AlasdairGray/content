    "description": "Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) is an oxidoreductase that catalyzes the reaction between superoxide anions and hydrogen to yield molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. The enzyme protects the cell against dangerous levels of superoxide. It belongs to the Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase family. It binds copper and zinc ions. The encoded isozyme is a soluble cytoplasmic protein, acting as a homodimer to convert naturally-occurring but harmful superoxide radicals to molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide.",
