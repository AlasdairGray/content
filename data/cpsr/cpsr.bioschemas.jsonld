  "sc:description": "a flexible variant report engine for germline screening in cancer.\n\nCancer Predisposition Sequencing Reporter (CPSR).\n\nThe Cancer Predisposition Sequencing Reporter (CPSR) is a computational workflow that interprets germline variants identified from next-generation sequencing in the context of cancer predisposition. The workflow is integrated with the framework that underlies the Personal Cancer Genome Reporter (PCGR), utilizing the Docker environment for encapsulation of code and software dependencies. While PCGR is intended for reporting and analysis of somatic variants detected in a tumor, CPSR is intended for reporting and ranking of germline variants in protein-coding genes that are implicated in cancer predisposition and inherited cancer syndromes",
