                "abstract": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.Background and objectives: The risk of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events following acute coronary syndrome is increased in people with diabetes. Predicting out-of-hospital outcomes upon follow-up remains difficult, and no simple, well-validated tools exist for this population at present. We aim to evaluate several factors in a competing risks model for actionable evaluation of the incidence of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events in diabetic outpatients following acute coronary syndrome. Methods: Retrospective analysis of consecutive patients admitted for acute coronary syndrome in two centres. A Fine\u2013Gray competing risks model was adjusted to predict major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events and all-cause mortality. A point-based score is presented that is based on this model. Results: Out of the 1400 patients, there were 783 (55.9%) with at least one major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular event (417 deaths). Of them, 143 deaths were due to non-major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events. Predictive Fine\u2013Gray models show that the \u2018PG-HACKER\u2019 risk factors (gender, age, peripheral arterial disease, left ventricle function, previous congestive heart failure, Killip class and optimal medical therapy) were associated to major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events. Conclusion: The PG-HACKER score is a simple and effective tool that is freely available and easily accessible to physicians and patients. The PG-HACKER score can predict major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events following acute coronary syndrome in patients with diabetes.",
