OVERVIEW A new computational approach for a fast and accurate prediction of MoRFs in protein sequences. MoRFchibi SYSTEM (Malhis et al 2016) includes three different predictors: MoRFCHiBi is most appropriate as a component predictor in other applications. [â€¦] | The University of British Columbia",
