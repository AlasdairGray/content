The checklist identifies three phases of an operation, each corresponding to a specific period in the normal flow of work: Before the induction of anaesthesia (“sign in”), before the incision of the skin (“time out”) and before the patient leaves the operating room (“sign out”). In each phase, a checklist coordinator must confirm that the surgery team has completed the listed tasks before it proceeds with the operation.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'organiziationevalcapacity', 'Surgical Safety Checklist', 'M and E', 'M and E Checklist'",
