  description: Models of SEIRS epidemic dynamics with extensions
  long_description: " This package implements generalized SEIRS infectious disease\n\
    \ dynamics models with extensions that model the effect of factors\n including\
    \ population structure, social distancing, testing, contact\n tracing, and quarantining\
    \ detected cases.\n .\n Notably, this package includes stochastic implementations\
    \ of these\n models on dynamic networks.\n"
