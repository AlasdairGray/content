  "sc:description": "A binning tool to reconstruct viral haplotypes from assembled contigs.\n\nBinning tools for strain-level viral contigs. The input to this program should be the contigs obtained from an assembly tool. We recommend to use PEHaplo (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29617936) because it is opimized for assembling viral strains. Our tests also showed that PEHaplo's output can lead to better performance for viral contig binning.\n\nThe output of this program are several sets of contigs. Each set corresponds to one haplotype (strain). The number of sets represent the number of haplotypes in the input data set.\n\nThe method is essentially an EM algorithm.\n\ngit clone https://github.com/chjiao/VirBin.git.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'VirBin new'",
