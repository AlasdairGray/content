  description: library for constructing, training and scoring hidden Markov models
    (dev)
  long_description: " Library for constructing, training and scoring hidden Markov\
    \ models.  It\n is provided with PSORTb but might be used separately.\n .\n PSORTb\
    \ enables prediction of bacterial protein subcellular localization\n (SCL) and\
    \ provides a quick and inexpensive means for gaining insight\n into protein function,\
    \ verifying experimental results, annotating newly\n sequenced bacterial genomes,\
    \ detecting potential cell surface/secreted\n drug targets, as well as identifying\
    \ biomarkers for microbes.\n .\n This library needed by PSORTb is distributed\
    \ separately by upstream.\n .\n This package contains the static library which\
    \ is needed to link PSORTb.\n"
