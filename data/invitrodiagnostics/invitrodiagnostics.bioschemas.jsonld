  "sc:description": "Passenger mutations as a target for the personalized therapy of cancer.\n\nThe American FDA approved the first comprehensive NGS diagnostic assay for cancer at the end of 2017, leading the way to personalised therapy of cancer and the massive employ of bioinformatics (https: www.fda.gov downloads medicaldevices productsandmedicalprocedures invitrodiagnostics ucm584603.pdf ). In NGS-detected genes from cancer patients, driver and passenger mutations can be distinguished. The former provides a proliferative advantage to cancer cells and are commonly found, the latter do not provide proliferative fitness and are different in different patients. However, some passenger mutations might occur in genes involved in metabolism and could be mildly deleterious for cancer cells.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE BROKEN!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'passenger', 'DrugBank' (bio.tools/drugbank), 'ucm584603.pdf', 'NGS-detected'",
