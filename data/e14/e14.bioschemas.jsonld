  "sc:description": "Cardiac risk assessment based on early Phase I data and PK-QTc analysis is concordant with the outcome of thorough QTc trials.\n\nCardiac safety assessment is a key regulatory requirement for almost all new drugs. Until recently, one evaluation aspect was via a specifically designated, expensive, and resource intensive thorough QTc study, and a by-time-point analysis using an intersection-union test (IUT). ICH E14 Q&A (R3) (http: www.ich.org fileadmin Public_Web_Site ICH_Products Guidelines Efficacy E14 E14_Q_As_R3__Step4.pdf) allows for analysis of the PK-QTc relationship using early Phase I data to assess QTc liability.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'ICH', 'QTc', 'thorough QTc', 'Cardiac risk assessment based early Phase I data PK-QTc analysis concordant outcome thorough QTc ...'",
