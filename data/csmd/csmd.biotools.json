The build process will then require approximately 500GB of additional disk space and 200GB of RAM. These genomes or sequences can be found in DBPATH/hg38/SEQ, DBPATH/AHG/SEQ, DBPATH/EHG/SEQ and DBPATH/RefSeq/bacteria/SEQ, respectively. And the indexed files will be saved in DBPATH/hg38, DBPATH/AHG, DBPATH/EHG and DBPATH/RefSeq/bacteria, respectively",

All rights reserved.Motivation: Microbiome analyses of clinical samples with low microbial biomass are challenging because of the very small quantities of microbial DNA relative to the human host, ubiquitous contaminating DNA in sequencing experiments and the large and rapidly growing microbial reference databases. Results: We present computational subtraction-based microbiome discovery (CSMD), a bioinformatics pipeline specifically developed to generate accurate species-level microbiome profiles for clinical samples with low microbial loads. CSMD applies strategies for the maximal elimination of host sequences with minimal loss of microbial signal and effectively detects microorganisms present in the sample with minimal false positives using a stepwise convergent solution. CSMD was benchmarked in a comparative evaluation with other classic tools on previously published well-characterized datasets. It showed higher sensitivity and specificity in host sequence removal and higher specificity in microbial identification, which led to more accurate abundance estimation. All these features are integrated into a free and easy-to-use tool. Additionally, CSMD applied to cell-free plasma DNA showed that microbial diversity within these samples is substantially broader than previously believed.
