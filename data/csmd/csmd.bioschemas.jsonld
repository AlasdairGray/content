  "sc:description": "A computational subtraction-based microbiome discovery pipeline for species-level characterization of clinical metagenomic samples.\n\nA computational pipeline for high-resolution profiling of low abundance microbiome in clinical samples using whole genome shotgun sequencing.\n\nComputation Subtraction-based Microbiome Discovery (CSMD).\n\nCSMD will work with a series of libraries listed in Table 2, including human-related genomes or sequences (21G) and all RefSeq bacteria genomes (150G, as of November 2018). The build process will then require approximately 500GB of additional disk space and 200GB of RAM. These genomes or sequences can be found in DBPATH/hg38/SEQ, DBPATH/AHG/SEQ, DBPATH/EHG/SEQ and DBPATH/RefSeq/bacteria/SEQ, respectively. And the indexed files will be saved in DBPATH/hg38, DBPATH/AHG, DBPATH/EHG and DBPATH/RefSeq/bacteria, respectively",
