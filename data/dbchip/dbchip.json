                "abstract": "Increasing number of ChIP-seq experiments are investigating transcription factor binding under multiple experimental conditions, for example, various treatment conditions, several distinct time points and different treatment dosage levels. Hence, identifying differential binding sites across multiple conditions is of practical importance in biological and medical research. To this end, we have developed a powerful and flexible program, called DBChIP, to detect differentially bound sharp binding sites across multiple conditions, with or without matching control samples. By assigning uncertainty measure to the putative differential binding sites, DBChIP facilitates downstream analysis. DBChIP is implemented in R programming language and can work with a wide range of sequencing file formats. Â© The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.",
