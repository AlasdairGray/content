      "sc:description": "Closed-loop multi-amplitude control for robust and dexterous performance of myoelectric prosthesis.\n\nIn the case of a hand amputation, the affected person can use a myoelectric prosthesis to substitute the missing limb and regain motor functions. Unfortunately, commercial methods for myoelectric control, although robust and simple, are unintuitive and cognitively taxing when applied to an advanced multifunctional prosthesis. The state-of-the-art methods developed in academia are based on machine learning and therefore require long training and suffer from a lack of robustness. This work presents a novel closed-loop multi-level amplitude controller (CMAC), which aims at overcoming these drawbacks. The CMAC implements three degrees-of-freedom (DoF) control by thresholding the muscle contraction intensity during wrist flexion and extension movements.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
