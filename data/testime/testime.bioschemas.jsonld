      "sc:description": "an application for evaluating the efficiency of Chinese input method engines in electronic medical record entry task.\n\nBACKGROUND:With the wide application of Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems, it has become a daily work for doctors using keyboards to input clinical information into the EMR system. Chinese Input Method Engine (IME) is essential for doctors to convert pinyin to Chinese characters, and an efficient IME would improve doctors' healthcare work. We developed a tool (called TestIME) to evaluating the efficiency of the current IMEs used in doctors' working scenario.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
