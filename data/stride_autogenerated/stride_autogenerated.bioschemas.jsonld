  "sc:description": "fluorescence method for direct, specific in situ detection of individual single- or double-strand DNA breaks in fixed cells.\n\nWe here describe a technique termed STRIDE (SensiTive Recognition of Individual DNA Ends), which enables highly sensitive, specific, direct in situ detection of single- or double-strand DNA breaks (sSTRIDE or dSTRIDE), in nuclei of single cells, using fluorescence microscopy. The sensitivity of STRIDE was tested using a specially developed CRISPR Cas9 DNA damage induction system, capable of inducing small clusters or individual single- or double-strand breaks.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| NAME EQUAL TO (PUB.
