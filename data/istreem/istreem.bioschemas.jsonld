It is a tool to promote product stewardship and regulatory compliance for chemical suppliers and manufacturers of formulated products of all sizes across commodity groups.\n\nPredicted environmental concentrations are calculated for the continental United States and several watersheds in Canada:.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'instream', 'microplastics'",
