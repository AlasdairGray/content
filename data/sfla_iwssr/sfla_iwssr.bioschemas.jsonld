The purpose of feature selection is selection of the least number of features in order to increase accuracy and decrease the cost of data classification. In recent years, due to appearance of high-dimensional datasets with low number of samples, classificatioâ€¦.\n\nSFLA_IWSSr is hybrid method for feature selection.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'IWSSr', 'SFLA'",
