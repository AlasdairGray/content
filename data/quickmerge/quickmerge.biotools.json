    "description": "Quickmerge is a program that uses complementary information from genomes assembled with long reads in order to improve contiguity, and works with assemblies derived from both Pacific Biosciences or Oxford Nanopore. Quickmerge will even work with hybrid assemblies made by combining long reads and Illumina short reads.",
