  long_description: " The UCSC Genome Browser was originally a graphical viewing tool\
    \ for the\n human genome assembly. Later a broad collection of vertebrate and\
    \ model\n organism assemblies and annotations, along with a large suite of tools\n\
    \ for viewing, analyzing and downloading data was included.\n .\n While the code\
    \ for the whole UCSC Genome Browser project is not DFSG\n free the basic library\
    \ has a free license.  This package provides the\n free library part of the UCSC\
    \ Genome Browser which is used in several\n other free software projects.\n .\n\
    \ This package contains the blat executable."
