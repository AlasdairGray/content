(2019). mountainClimber identifies alternative transcription start and polyadenylation sites in RNA-Seq. Cell Systems | mountainClimber is a tool built for identifying alternative transcription start sites (ATS) and alternative polyadenylation sites (APA) from RNA-Seq by finding significant change points in read coverage. It is made up of three main steps which can be used in isolation:",
