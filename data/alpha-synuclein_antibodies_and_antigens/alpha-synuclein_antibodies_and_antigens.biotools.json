    "description": "Human alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) is a small acidic protein with three domains namely N-terminal lipid-binding \u03b1-helix, amyloid-binding central domain (residues 1\u201387), the core region (residues 61\u201395, which is involved in fibril formation and aggregation), and the C-terminal domain (residues 96\u2013140). Structurally, the C-terminal domain of \u03b1-syn is present in a random coil structure due to its low hydrophobicity and high net negative charge and might be involved in the pathology of \u03b1-syn.",
