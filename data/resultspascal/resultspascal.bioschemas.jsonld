  "sc:description": "a biological insight into the novel associated genes.\n\nBACKGROUND:Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) which may significantly impact on the affected individual's life. ADHD is acknowledged to have a high heritability component (70-80%). Recently, a meta-analysis of GWAS (Genome Wide Association Studies) has demonstrated the association of several independent loci. Our main aim here, is to apply PASCAL (pathway scoring algorithm), a new gene-based analysis (GBA) method, to the summary statistics obtained in this meta-analysis. PASCAL will take into account the linkage disequilibrium (LD) across genomic regions in a different way than the most commonly employed GBA methods (MAGMA or VEGAS (Versatile Gene-based Association Study)).\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'CONCLUSIONS:PASCAL', 'PASCAL', 'Gene-based analysis ADHD using PASCAL'",
