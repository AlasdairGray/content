    "description": "Creative Enzymes is a leading professional in the field of enzyme ligand screening. We are specialized in rapid and accurate evaluation of substrates, inhibitors, and other ligands for specific enzymes, based on high-throughput experiments or computational simulation results. In other cases, we also provide screening of active enzymes against specific substrates or inhibitors, which would help to identify the functioning enzymes in a pathway or the biological target of a small molecule.",
