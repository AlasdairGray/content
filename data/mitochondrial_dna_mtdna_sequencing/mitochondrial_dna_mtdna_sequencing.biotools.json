    "description": "Mitochondrial DNA sequencing is available on both Illumina\u2019s MiSeq, and PacBio Sequel System. Illumina next-generation sequencing (NGS) has the potential to transform mtDNA analysis. Take advantage of PacBio\u2019s long reads, CD Genomics present amplification-free, full-length sequencing of linearized mtDNA. Full-length sequencing allows variant phasing along the entire mitochondrial genome, identification of heteroplasmic variants, and detection of epigenetic modifications that are lost in amplicon-based methods.",
