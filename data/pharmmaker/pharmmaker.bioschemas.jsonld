See PCA of X-ray structures or Bioinformatics article for more details.\n\nWorkflow for comparative analysis of sequence evolution and structural dynamics is shown. See Evol Applications or Mol Biol Evol article for more details.\n\nBahar lab, University of Pittsburgh.\n\nPharmmaker program: http://prody.csb.pitt.edu/tutorials/pharmmaker/pharmmaker.zip.\n\nResults from comparative analysis of residue conservation, conformational mobility, and coevolutionary patterns for uracil-DNA glycosylase. See Mol Biol Evol article or Conservation and Coevolution Analysis for more details.\n\nCoevolution of NEF-binding residues analzyed using mutual information is displayed for the Hsp70 ATPase domain.\n\nFigure 1",
