  "sc:description": "Metal-Organic Framework Preserves the Biorecognition of Antibodies on Nanoscale Surfaces Validated by Single-Molecule Force Spectroscopy.\n\nAntibody biorecognition forms the basis for numerous biomedical applications such as diagnostic assays, targeted drug delivery, and targeted cancer imaging. However, antibodies, especially after being conjugated to surfaces or nanostructures, suffer from stability issues when stored under nonrefrigeration conditions. Therefore, enhancing the stability of antibodies on surfaces and nanostructures under ambient and elevated temperatures is of paramount importance for many nanobiotechnology applications. In this study, we introduce a simple and facile approach based on a metal-organic framework (MOF) coating to preserve the biorecognition capability of antibodies immobilized on nanoscale surfaces after exposure to elevated temperatures for a prolonged period.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'MOF', 'coating'",
