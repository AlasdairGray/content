This package provides the generalized pipeline to perform integrative analysis of epi-genomic data (methylation, copy number alteration, mutation, microRNA, etc.) and gene-expression data from paired samples, and consists of 3 major modules:.\n\nIntegrative analysis of (Epi-)DNA and Gene Expression Data.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/combrex (BU.EDU), bio.tools/visant (BU.EDU)",
