  "sc:description": "Zebrafish MITF-Low Melanoma Subtype Models Reveal Transcriptional Subclusters and MITF-Independent Residual Disease.\n\nThe melanocyte-inducing transcription factor (MITF)-low melanoma transcriptional signature is predictive of poor outcomes for patients, but little is known about its biological significance, and animal models are lacking. Here, we used zebrafish genetic models with low activity of Mitfa (MITF-low) and established that the MITF-low state is causal of melanoma progression and a predictor of melanoma biological subtype. MITF-low zebrafish melanomas resembled human MITF-low melanomas and were enriched for stem and invasive (mesenchymal) gene signatures.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'MITF-independent', 'MITF-low melanomas', 'melanomas MITF-independent', 'melanomas'",
