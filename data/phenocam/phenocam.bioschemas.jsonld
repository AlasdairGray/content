  "sc:description": "Tracking vegetation phenology across diverse biomes using Version 2.0 of the PhenoCam Dataset.\n\nAn R Interface and Post-Processing Framework for PhenoCam Web Services.\n\nPhenoCam Installation Tool (PIT).\n\nFacilitates the retrieval and post-processing of PhenoCam time series. The post-processing of PhenoCam data includes outlier removal and the generation of data products such as phenological transition dates. If requested complementary Daymet climate data will be downloaded and merged with the PhenoCam data for modelling purposes. For a detailed overview of the assumptions made during post-processing I refer publications by Hufkens et al. (2018) and Richardson et al. (2018). Please cite the Hufkens et al. (2018) paper when using the package. A worked example is included below and in the package vignette.\n\nVegetation Phenology from Digital Camera Imagery, 2000-2018.\n\nClick on an image to go to that site's page.\n\nOr go to the location map to find a site geographically",
