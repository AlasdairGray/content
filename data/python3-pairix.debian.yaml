  description: 1D/2D indexing and querying with a pair of genomic coordinates
  long_description: " Pairix is a tool for indexing and querying on a block-compressed\
    \ text\n file containing pairs of genomic coordinates.\n .\n Pairix is a stand-alone\
    \ C program that was written on top of tabix as a\n tool for the 4DN-standard\
    \ pairs file format describing Hi-C data:\n pairs_format_specification.md\n .\n\
    \ However, Pairix can be used as a generic tool for indexing and querying\n any\
    \ bgzipped text file containing genomic coordinates, for either 2D- or\n 1D- indexing\
    \ and querying.\n .\n For example: given the custom text file below, you want\
    \ to extract\n specific lines from the Pairs file further below. An awk command\
    \ would\n read the Pairs file from beginning to end. Pairix creates an index and\n\
    \ uses it to access the file from a relevant position by taking advantage\n of\
    \ bgzf compression, allowing for a fast query on large files.\n"
