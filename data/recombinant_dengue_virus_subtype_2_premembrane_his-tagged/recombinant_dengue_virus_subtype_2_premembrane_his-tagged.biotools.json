    "description": "Dengue virus (DENV) in one of four serotypes is the cause of dengue fever. It is a mosquito-borne single positive-stranded RNA virus of the family Flaviviridae; genus Flavivirus. All four serotypes can cause the full spectrum of disease. Its genome is about 11000 bases that codes for three structural proteins, capsid protein C, membrane protein M, envelope protein E; seven nonstructural proteins, NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b, NS5; and short non-coding regions on both the 5' and 3' ends. Further classification of each serotype into genotypes often relates to the region where particular strains are commonly found or were first found..",
