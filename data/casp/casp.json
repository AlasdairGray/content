    "description": "Image analysis tool in comet assay. It has been developed to work with either color, or gray-scale images of fluorescence-stained comets saved in TIF format. In its present version it does not control a video or CCD camera. Comets stained with silver (dark cells on white background) must be converted into negative images in order to be analysed correctly.",

                "abstract": "The single-cell gel electrophoresis, also known as the comet assay, has gained wide-spread popularity as a simple and reliable method to measure genotoxic and cytotoxic effects of physical and chemical agents as well as kinetics of DNA repair. Cells are generally stained with fluorescent dyes. The analysis of comets - damaged cells which form a typical comet-shaped pattern - is greatly facilitated by the use of a computer image-analysis program. Although several image-analysis programs are available commercially, they are expensive and their source codes are not provided. For Macintosh computers a cost-free public domain macro is available on the Internet. No ready for use, cost-free program exists for the PC platform. We have, therefore, developed such a public domain program under the GNU license for PC computers. The program is called CASP and can be run on a variety of hardware and software platforms. Its practical merit was tested on human lymphocytes exposed to γ-rays and found to yield reproducible results. The binaries for Windows 95 and Linux, together with the source code can be obtained from: http://www.casp.of.pl. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",
