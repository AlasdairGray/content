    "description": "Orthoreoviruses are members of the Reoviridae virus family. They have double stranded RNA genomes and are therefore group III viruses. These viruses infect vertebrates (including humans) but no disease symptoms are normally seen. In some cases however, orthoreovirus infection can lead to complications, especially in mice and birds.",
