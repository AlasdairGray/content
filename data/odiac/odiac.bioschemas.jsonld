In 2009, the first version of ODIAC was developed by Drs. Tomohiro Oda (now at USRA/NASA Goddard) and Shamil Maksyutov under the Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) project at the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES) in Japan.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'ODIAC2016', 'ODIAC2017'",
