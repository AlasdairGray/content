  description: minimal ANSI C thread pool - development files
  long_description: " These are C development files for the C-Thread-Pool library.\n\
    \ This is a minimal but advanced threadpool implementation.\n  * ANCI C and POSIX\
    \ compliant\n  * Pause/resume/wait as you like\n  * Simple easy-to-digest API\n\
    \  * Well tested\n This software does not ship as a shared library since it is\n\
    \ very small and there is a technical difficulty with this\n implementation.\n"
