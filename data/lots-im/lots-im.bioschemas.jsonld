LOTS-IM generates an irregularity map (IM) that represents all voxels as irregularity values with respect to the ones considered \"normal\". Unlike probability values, IM represents both regular and irregular regions in the brain based on the original MRI's texture information.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
