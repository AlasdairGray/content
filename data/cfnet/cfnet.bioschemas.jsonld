  "sc:description": "Rotation equivariant and invariant neural networks for microscopy image analysis | Conic Convolution and DFT Network (CFNet) combines a novel rotation equivariant convolution scheme, called conic convolution, and the DFT to aid networks in learning rotation-invariant tasks. This network has been especially designed to improve performance of CNNs on automated computational tasks related to microscopy image analysis",
