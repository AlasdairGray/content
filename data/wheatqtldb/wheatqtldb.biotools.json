                "abstract": "\u00a9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.During the last three decades, QTL analysis in wheat has been conducted for a variety of individual traits, so that thousands of QTL along with the linked markers, their genetic positions and contribution to phenotypic variation (PV) for concerned traits are now known. However, no exhaustive database for wheat QTL is currently available at a single platform. Therefore, the present database was prepared which is an exhaustive information resource for wheat QTL data from the published literature till May, 2020. QTL data from both interval mapping and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been included for the following classes of traits: (i) morphological traits, (ii) N and P use efficiency, (iii) traits for biofortification (Fe, K, Se, and Zn contents), (iv) tolerance to abiotic stresses including drought, water logging, heat stress, pre-harvest sprouting and salinity, (v) resistance to biotic stresses including those due to bacterial, fungal, nematode and insects, (vi) quality traits, and (vii) a variety of physiological traits, (viii) developmental traits, and (ix) yield and its related traits. For the preparation of the database, literature was searched for data on QTL/marker-trait associations (MTAs), curated and then assembled in the form of WheatQTLdb. The available information on metaQTL, epistatic QTL and candidate genes, wherever available, is also included in the database. Information on QTL in this WheatQTLdb includes QTL names, traits, associated markers, parental genotypes, crosses/mapping populations, association mapping panels and other useful information. To our knowledge, WheatQTLdb prepared by us is the largest collection of QTL (11,552), epistatic QTL (107) and metaQTL (330) data for hexaploid wheat to be used by geneticists and plant breeders for further studies involving fine mapping, cloning, and marker-assisted selection (MAS) during wheat breeding.",
