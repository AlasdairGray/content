Just edit, push, and your changes are live.\n\nDeepImageJ is a user-friendly plugin that enables the use of a variety of pre-trained deep learning models in ImageJ and Fiji. The plugin bridges the gap between deep learning and standard life-science applications. DeepImageJ runs image-to-image operations on a standard CPU-based computer and does not require any deep learning expertise.\n\nWebsites for you and your projects.\n\nHosted directly from your GitHub repository. Just edit, push, and your changes are live.\n\nReady to get started? Build your own site from scratch or generate one for your project.\n\nSend comments to wsr nih.gov.
