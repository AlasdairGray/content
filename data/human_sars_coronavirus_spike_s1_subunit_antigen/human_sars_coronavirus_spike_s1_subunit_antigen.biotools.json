    "description": "The SARS coronavirus, sometimes shortened to SARS-CoV, is the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). On April 16, 2003, following the outbreak of SARS in Asia and secondary cases elsewhere in the world, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a press release stating that the coronavirus identified by a number of laboratories was the official cause of SARS. Samples of the virus are being held in laboratories in New York, San Francisco, Manila, Hong Kong, and Toronto. protein E is a kinesin-like motor protein that accumulates in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Unlike other centromere-associated proteins, it is not present during interphase and first appears at the centromere region of chromosomes during prometaphase. CENPE is proposed to be one of the motors responsible for mammalian chromosome movement and/or spindle elongation.",
