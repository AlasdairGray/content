      "sc:description": "learning health systems and how they can integrate with patient care.\n\nPROBLEM:Learning health systems (LHS) are an underexplored concept. How LHS will operate in clinical practice is not well understood. This paper investigates the relationships between LHS, clinical care process specifications (CCPS) and the established levels of medical practice to enable LHS integration into daily healthcare practice. METHODS:Concept analysis and thematic analysis were used to develop an LHS characterisation. Pathway theory was used to create a framework by relating LHS, CCPS, health information systems and the levels of medical practice. A case study approach evaluates the framework in an established health informatics project. RESULTS:Five concepts were identified and used to define the LHS learning cycle.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'LHS', 'LHS CCPS', 'CCPS', 'characterisation LHS'",
