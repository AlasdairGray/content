  "sc:description": "inferring higher-order trait interactions associated with complex biological phenotypes.\n\nAbstract Machine learning is helping the interpretation of biological complexity by enabling the inference and classification of cellular, organismal and ecological phenotypes based on large datasets, e.g. from genomic, transcriptomic and metagenomic analyses. A number of available algorithms can help search these datasets to uncover patterns associated with specific traits, including disease-related attributes. While, in many instances, treating an algorithm as a black box is sufficient, it is interesting to pursue an enhanced understanding of how system variables end up contributing to a specific output, as an avenue towards new mechanistic insight. Here we address this challenge through a suite of algorithms, named BowSaw, which takes advantage of the structure of a trained random forest algorithm to identify combinations of variables (“rules”) frequently used for classification",
