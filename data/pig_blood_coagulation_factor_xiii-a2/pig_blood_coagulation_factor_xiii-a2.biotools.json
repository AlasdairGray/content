    "description": "Recombinant pig Factor XIII is a homodimer (a2) composed of two chains held together by non covalent bonds. After activation of the zymogen by Thrombin and Ca2+ to its active form (a*2, Factor XIIIa), Factor XIIIa catalyzes the formation of covalent bridges (\u03b5-(\u03b3-glutamyl) lysine bonds) between fibrin units to increase the elasticity of the clot network. The resulting crosslinked fibrin is insoluble and resistant to lysis.",
