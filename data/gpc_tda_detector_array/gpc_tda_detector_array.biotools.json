    "description": "Viscotek TDA sets the standard for GPC/SEC technology and is the world's leading multi-detector platform. As a triple detector array, it uses all the refractive index, viscometer, and light scattering detectors to work together, and each detector provides complementary data about the large molecule being analyzed. In its Tetra Detector format, the addition of a UV detector can provide a large amount of other composition data, especially when using an optional photodiode array (PDA or DAD) to perform spectral measurements at all wavelengths simultaneously.",
