  description: libraries for using data in the INSDC Sequence Read Archives (devel)
  long_description: " Much of the data submitted these days, for example in BAM, Illumina\n\
    \ export.txt, and Complete Genomics formats, contain alignment\n information.\
    \ With aligned data, NCBI uses Compression by Reference,\n which only stores the\
    \ differences in base pairs between sequence data\n and the segment it aligns\
    \ to. The process to restore original data, for\n example as FastQ, requires fast\
    \ access to the reference sequences that\n the original data was aligned to. NCBI\
    \ recommends that SRA users\n dedicate local disk space to store references downloaded\
    \ from the NCBI\n SRA site. As of Fall 2014, the complete collection of these\
    \ reference\n sequences is 66 GB. While it isn't usually necessary to download\
    \ the\n entirety of the reference sequences, this should give you an idea of the\n\
    \ scale of the storage requirement. By default, the Toolkit will download\n missing\
    \ reference sequences on demand and cache them in the user's home\n directory.\
    \ The location of this cache is configurable, as is whether the\n download is\
    \ automatic or manual.\n .\n This is the development package.\n"
