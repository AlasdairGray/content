If you would like to install DNCON2 in some other operating systems, first test if 'FreeContact' can be installed in it. If, for some reason, you do not have a Ubuntu machine, and cannot install FreeContact, you can still use DNCON2. With just a few code updates you can skip using the FreeContact tool. You will get slightly less precise results",
