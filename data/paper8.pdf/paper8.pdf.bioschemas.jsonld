  "sc:description": "A microservice-based portal for X-ray transient and variable sources.\n\nModern soft X-ray observatories can yield unique insights into time domain astrophysics, and a huge amount of information is stored - and largely unexploited - in data archives. Like a treasure-hunt, the EXTraS project is harvesting the hitherto unexplored temporal domain information buried in the serendipitous data collected by the European Photon Imaging Camera (EPIC) instrument onboard the ESA XMM-Newton, in 16 years of observations. Part of this analysis is performed through a dedicated science gateway, the EXTraS portal, whose initial release is the subject of this paper.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'ceur-ws', 'observatories', 'treasure-hunt', 'XMM-Newton'",
