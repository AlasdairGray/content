    "description": "Browser-based application for interactive processing of large-scale metabolomics (MS1) data. Developed by the Lewis Research Group at the University of Calgary in Alberta, Canada.\n\nThe Metabolomics Integrator (MINT)) is a post-processing tool for liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) based metabolomics. Metabolomics is the study of all metabolites (small chemical compounds) in a biological sample e.g. from bacteria or a human blood sample. The metabolites can be used to define biomarkers used in medicine to find treatments for diseases or for the development of diagnostic tests or for the identification of pathogens such as methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).",
