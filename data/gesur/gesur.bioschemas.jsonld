  "sc:description": "Identification of transcriptional isoforms associated with survival in cancer patient.\n\nGESUR performs overall survival (OS) or disease free survival (DFS, also called relapse-free survival and RFS) analysis based on expression of a gene set. GESUR uses Log-rank test, a.k.a the Mantelâ€“Cox test, for hypothesis test. Cohorts thresholds can be adjusted, and gene-pairs can be used. The cox proportional hazard ratio and the 95% confidence interval information can also be included in the survival plot.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/gepia (CANCER-PKU.CN).\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'TAPPs'",
