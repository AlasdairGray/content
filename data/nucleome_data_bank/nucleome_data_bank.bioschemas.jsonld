The server is also made for visualization the structures and dynamics of the genome, allowing users to explore the 3D organization of chromosomes from their computer.\n\nThis platform enables users to visualize and annotate the 3D chromosome structures with experimental tracks from ENCODE or with their own data, allowing for an integrative experience for all genome scientists.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/PhyloNet_autogenerated (RICE.EDU).\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'NDB'",
