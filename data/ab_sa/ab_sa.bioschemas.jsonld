Application to Salmonella Typhimurium environmental strains.\n\nAccessory Based Source Attribution.\n\nAB_SA - Source attribution based on accessory genes.\n\nThe AB_SA (\"Accessory-based source attribution\") method aims at attributing the origin of bacterial strains associated to human cases or isolated in environment. AB_SA method relies on accessory genes and multinomial logistic model. AB_SA uses as input a list of enriched genes in the sources, it trains and tests the multinomial logistic model and can predict from genomes of unkown strains the membership probabilities to the sources",
