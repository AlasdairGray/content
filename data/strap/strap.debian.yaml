description: 'Strap is started from the menu "Science" in the "Applications" menu
  or with the shell command strap_protein_alignment. Alignments can be manually edited
  or computed automatically using sequence and/or structure based methods. Information
  can be attached to proteins and residue selections such as free text notes, balloon
  messages, cross-references as well as 3D and PDF display styles. Alignments can
  be exported in several formats: Multiple-Fasta, ClustalW, MSF, HSSP, Jalview. Decorated
  alignments with residue annotations and secondary structure cartoons can be exported
  to PDF, HTML and Word-processors to create figures in publication quality - see
  http://3d-alignment.eu/ for details. Strap is an integrated environment for Bioinformatics
  tools and resources like DAS sequence features, 3D-visualization, structure prediction
  and Blast search. It is scriptable and extendable and can be used by other programs
  to display sequence alignments and 3D-superpositions.'
