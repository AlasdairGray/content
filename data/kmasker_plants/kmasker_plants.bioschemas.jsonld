  "sc:description": "a tool for assessing complex sequence space in plant species.\n\nKmasker - a tool for masking and exploring of sequences from plant species.\n\na versatile tool for masking and exploring of sequences from plant species.\n\nKmasker plants is a tool for the automatic detection of sequence regions with meaningful k-mer characteristics. This can be sequences with highly abundant k-mer patterns (repeats), regions with diverging k-mer patterns between two studied WGS samples or segments with high target specificity.\n\nThe installation instructions are available at: INSTALL.md. There, you find our list of requirements of external tools. Please make sure, that these are in your PATH environemnt if you installed from source. If not please specify them in the 'etc/kmasker.config' file.\n\nKmasker uses an interal repository for reuse of kindex structures.\n\nFISH analysis k-mer analysis Krispr analysis.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Kmasker' (bio.tools/Kmasker)",
