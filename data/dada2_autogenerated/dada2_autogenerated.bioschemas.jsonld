      "sc:description": "Microbiota Analysis Using Two-step PCR and Next-generation 16S rRNA Gene Sequencing.\n\nHere we walk through version 1.12 of the DADA2 pipeline on a small multi-sample dataset. Our starting point is a set of Illumina-sequenced paired-end fastq files that have been split (or “demultiplexed”) by sample and from which the barcodes/adapters have already been removed. The end product is an amplicon sequence variant (ASV) table, a higher-resolution analogue of the traditional OTU table, which records the number of times each exact amplicon sequence variant was observed in each sample. We also assign taxonomy to the output sequences, and demonstrate how the data can be imported into the popular phyloseq R package for the analysis of microbiome data.\n\n||| NAME (DADA2) SIMILAR TO (PUB. DIFFERENT) bio.tools/dada2 (dada2).\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Denoising Algorithm-2 DADA2'",
