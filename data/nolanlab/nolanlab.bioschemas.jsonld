      "sc:description": "Quantitative lung morphology: semi-automated measurement of mean linear intercept.\n\nOur studies focus on predictors of lung function loss in never smoking firefighters from the World Trade Center exposed Fire Department of New York cohort. This group has pre-9/11/01 clinical/spirometric data and continues to have serial post-9/11 assessments. In preliminary data, we demonstrate that elevated serum levels of one such LDL byproduct soon after intense WTC dust exposure is a risk factor for developing abnormal forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) years later. This development of lung injury is what we call World Trade Center Lung Injury (WTC-LI).\n\nOur group has demonstrated that mediators of Metabolic Syndrome, inflammation and vascular injury in serum sampled within 6 months of 9 11 are predictive of eventual abnormal lung function.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'MLI', 'MLI PM-exposed', 'chords', 'MLIactual'",
