  "sc:description": "Viral genome sequencing is a fast and efficient method for research on viral replication, packaging, function of terminase, transcription regulation, and metabolism of host cell. CD genomics platform holds great potential for viral genome sequencing. A comprehensive virus sequences will facilitate interpretation of viral metagenomics data by providing reference genomes, lead to a better understanding of virus diversity, ecology, adaptation and evolution, and enable the prediction of emerging infectious diseases caused by viruses.  CD genomics can deliver high quality sequencing data for your virus genome of interest. Contact us for assistance in configuring your project.",
