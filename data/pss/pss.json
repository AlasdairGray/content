                "abstract": "Characterizing the variability within an ensemble of protein structures is a common requirement in structural biology and bioinformatics. With the increasing number of protein structures becoming available, there is a need for new tools capable of automating the structural comparison of large ensemble of structures. We present Protein Structural Statistics (PSS), a command-line program written in Perl for Unix-like environments, dedicated to the calculation of structural statistics for a set of proteins. PSS can perform multiple sequence alignments, structure superpositions, calculate Cartesian and dihedral coordinate statistics, and execute cluster analyses. An HTML report that contains a convenient summary of results with figures, tables, and hyperlinks can also be produced. PSS is a new tool providing an automated way to compare multiple structures. It integrates various types of structural analyses through an user-friendly and flexible interface, facilitating the access to powerful but more specialized programs. PSS is easy to modify and extend and is distributed under a free and open source license. The relevance of PSS is illustrated by examples of application to pertinent biological problems.
