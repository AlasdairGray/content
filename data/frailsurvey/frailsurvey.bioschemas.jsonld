      "sc:description": "RELIABLE SMARTPHONE APPLICATION FOR SELF-ASSESSMENT OF FRAILTY.\n\nAbstractFrailty is a clinical syndrome whose signs and symptoms are predictors of health complications, making this a major public health problem. FRAILSURVEY, which was considered a good practice by several entities, is a smartphone application that allows an easy assessment of frailty, available in Portuguese, English and Italian, on both iOS and Android stores. Smartphone-based assessment has been proven to be a useful diagnostic tool for patients, although few applications have demonstrated reliability. With this work we aimed to test the reliability of FRAILSURVEY as a tool to assess frailty, and to study peopleâ€™s preference on which way to assess frailty.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
