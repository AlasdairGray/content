                "abstract": "The FISH server is highly accurate in identifying the family membership of domains in a query protein sequence, even in the case of very low sequence identities to known homologues. A performance test using SCOP sequences and an E-value cut-off of 0.1 showed that 99.3% of the top hits are to the correct family saHMM. Matches to a query sequence provide the user not only with an annotation of the identified domains and hence a hint to their function, but also with probable 2D and 3D structures, as well as with pairwise and multiple sequence alignments to homologues with low sequence identity. In addition, the FISH server allows users to upload and search their own protein sequence collection or to quarry public protein sequence data bases with individual saHMMs. TheFISH server can be accessed at http://babel.ucmp.umu.se/fish/.
