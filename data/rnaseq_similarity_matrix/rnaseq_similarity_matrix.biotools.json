    "description": "visually identify sample mix-ups in RNASeq data using a 'genomic' sequence similarity matrix.\n\nA pipeline to detect sample mix-ups in RNASeq data.\n\nGenerate a sample similarity matrices from RNASeq data.\n\nSample confusion is a common laboratory problem. In RNASeq this is frequently tested for by checking whether sex-specific genes (e.g. those located on the Y chromosome or the X inactivation gene) are congruent with the sex listed for that sample in the metadata. However, this method cannot be used to detect sample confusion between patients of the same sex, and is less sensitive when the phenotype skews the sex ratio of samples away from 1:1.\n\nHere we present a tool that leverages RNASeq reads to call genomic SNPs, and use that to generate a similarity matrix between all samples to detect sample confusion.\n\ngit clone https://github.com/nicokist/RNASeq_similarity_matrix",

All rights reserved.Mistakes in linking a patient\u2019s biological samples with their phenotype data can confound RNA-Seq studies. The current method for avoiding such sample mix-ups is to test for inconsistencies between biological data and known phenotype data such as sex. However, in DNA studies a common QC step is to check for unexpected relatedness between samples. Here, we extend this method to RNA-Seq, which allows the detection of duplicated samples without relying on identifying inconsistencies with phenotype data. Results: We present RNASeq_similarity_matrix: an automated tool to generate a sequence similarity matrix from RNA-Seq data, which can be used to visually identify sample mix-ups. This is particularly useful when a study contains multiple samples from the same individual, but can also detect contamination in studies with only one sample per individual.",
