  "sc:description": "BpForms is a toolkit for unambiguously describing the molecular structure (atoms and bonds) of DNA, RNA, and proteins, including non-canonical monomeric forms (subunits which compose polymers), crosslinks, nicks, and circular topologies. By concretely describing the molecular structure of biopolymers, BpForms aims to help epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, systems biology, and synthetic biology researchers share and integrate information about DNA modification, post-transcriptional modification, post-translational modification, expanded genetic codes, and synthetic parts. In particular, BpForms was developed to help researchers collaboratively develop whole-cell computational models.",
