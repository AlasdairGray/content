    "description": "A Global Online Platform on the Management of Children With ADPKD.\n\nAutosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common monogenic causes of kidney failure with an estimated worldwide prevalence of 1 in 500-2500 live births and affecting approximately 13 million individuals worldwide, representing a major socio-economic medical problem in the world. ADPKD is characterized by the progressive development and enlargement of multiple renal cysts in all nephron segments, progressively leading to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in 50% of patients by the age of 60 years.\n\nADPKD arises as a consequence of mutations in the PKD1 (80% of patients) or PKD2 (15% of patients) genes, which encode respectively the proteins polycystin-1 (PC1) and -2 (PC2).\n\nTogether, working on ADPedKD, we will aim at completing these gaps and having a better understanding of the ADPKD pediatric perspective.",
