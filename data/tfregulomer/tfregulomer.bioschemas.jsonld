The binding motifs predicted in-silico from MethMotif and GTRD describe cell specific transcription factor (TF) binding propensities, while the DNA methylation profiles from MethMotif portray a second epigenetic dimension in TF binding events. The whole toolbox allows a better understanding of the TF binding propensities in a cell-specific manner.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'TFregulomeR R-library'",
