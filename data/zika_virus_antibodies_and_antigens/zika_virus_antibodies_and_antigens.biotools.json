    "description": "Zika virus (ZIKV), a member of the Flaviviridae family, is an RNA virus. The complete Zika genome consists of a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA molecule encoding a polyprotein which is cleaved to structural proteins (capsid protein, envelope protein, glycoprotein precursor which is split into the pr protein and the M protein) and non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5 proteins).",
