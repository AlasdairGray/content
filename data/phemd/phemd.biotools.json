    "description": "PhEMD is a package for relating a network of single-cell samples. By first modeling the cell-state landscape of a model system and then computing pairwise distances between samples using EMD, PhEMD constructs a low-dimensional embedding that uncovers intrinsic manifold structure.",

For this purpose, we developed \u2018phenotypic earth mover\u2019s distance\u2019 (PhEMD). PhEMD is a general method for embedding a \u2018manifold of manifolds\u2019, in which each datapoint in the higher-level manifold (of biospecimens) represents a collection of points that span a lower-level manifold (of cells). We apply PhEMD to a newly generated drug-screen dataset and demonstrate that PhEMD uncovers axes of cell subpopulational variation among a large set of perturbation conditions. Moreover, we show that PhEMD can be used to infer the phenotypes of biospecimens not directly profiled. Applied to clinical datasets, PhEMD generates a map of the patient-state space that highlights sources of patient-to-patient variation. PhEMD is scalable, compatible with leading batch-effect correction techniques and generalizable to multiple experimental designs.",
