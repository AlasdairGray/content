      "sc:description": "predicting the spatial distribution of adaptive genetic variants under future climatic conditions.\n\nAbstract In a context of rapid global change, one of the key components for the survival of species is their genetic adaptive potential. Many methods have been developed to identify adaptive genetic variants, but few tools were made available to integrate this knowledge into conservation management. We present here the SPatial Areas of Genotype probability (SPAG), using genotype-environment logistic associations to map the probability of finding beneficial variants in a study area. We define a univariate model predicting the spatial distribution of a single genotype, and three multivariate models allowing the integration of several genotypes, potentially associated with various environmental variables.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'SPAGs', 'SPatial Areas Genotype probability'",
