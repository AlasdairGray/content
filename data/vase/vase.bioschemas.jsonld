      "sc:description": "Facilities that make the PDB data collection more powerful.\n\nVisualization of Alignments Structures and Entropy.\n\nWelcome to the tool for Visualization of Alignments, Structure and Entropy (VASE).\n\nVASE is a web-tool for visualizing alignments on a protein structure. It allows you to enter the ID of a protein structure in PDB format for which VASE will generate an interface. VASE will show a set of homologous sequences, aligned to the sequence of your structure, along with entropy/variability data and a 3D interface. Here's an example: 1CRN.\n\nIf you only want VASE to display the content of a series of VASE-format xml files, then you can set 'xmlonly' to true and set the 'cache' path to the directory where the files are located.\n\nThe configuration file is at src/main/resources/config.properties.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'PDB', 'PDF-formatted', 'remade'",
