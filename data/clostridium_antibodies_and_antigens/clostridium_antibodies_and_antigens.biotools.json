    "description": "Clostridium perfringens is a spore-forming anaerobic bacterium that is widespread in the environment and is pathogenic to humans and animals. Strains are classified into five toxinotypes based on the production of four toxins (alpha, beta, epsilon, and iota), occurring during the exponential growth phase. In addition, some strains of types A to E synthesize an C. perfringens enterotoxin (CPE), which is formed only during sporulation.",
