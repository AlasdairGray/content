The SCDO is currently under development and its purpose is to 1) establish community standardized SCD terms and descriptions, 2) establish canonical and hierarchical representation of knowledge on SCD and 3) link to other ontologies and bodies of work such as DO, PhenX MeSH, ICD, NCI’s thesaurus, SNOMED and OMIM.\n\nThe Sickle Cell Disease Ontology (SCDO) project is a collaboration between H3ABioNet (Pan African Bioinformatics Network) and SPAN (Sickle Cell Disease Pan African Network).\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Sickle Cell Disease Ontology', 'SCD overcomes'",
