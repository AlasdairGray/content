Published by American Chemical Society.QCloud is a cloud-based system to support proteomics laboratories in daily quality assessment using a user-friendly interface, easy setup, and automated data processing. Since its release, QCloud has facilitated automated quality control for proteomics experiments in many laboratories. QCloud provides a quick and effortless evaluation of instrument performance that helps to overcome many analytical challenges derived from clinical and translational research. Here we present an improved version of the system, QCloud2. This new version includes enhancements in the scalability and reproducibility of the quality-control pipelines, and it features an improved front end for data visualization, user management, and chart annotation. The QCloud2 system also includes programmatic access and a standalone local version.",
