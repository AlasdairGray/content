  "sc:description": "A model to estimate differential co-occurrence networks in microbiome studies.\n\n(Note: This package is currently in development) Microbiome Differential Network Estimation (mdine) allows the estimation of OTU co-occurrence networks within two separate groups, where the networks are defined through precision matrices. The difference between the two precision matrices is also estimated, along with corresponding interval estimates. This work was developed in the Greenwood Lab at McGill University.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'AVAILABILITY:MDiNE'",
