You can either run it locally on your PC (go to installation method 1) or host it for free online on shinyapps.io (go to installation method 2). Either way, you first need to install the current version of Cran R on your computer. If you do not have R yet, you can download it here:.\n\nProgram for the analysis of binding events.\n\nAn open source software for the platform-independent analysis of molecular binding events.\n\nIt is also possible to download Anabel. Please find all the information on this page: https://github.com/SKscience/Anabel.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no free app at the moment. Please check back later!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Anabel 2.0'",
