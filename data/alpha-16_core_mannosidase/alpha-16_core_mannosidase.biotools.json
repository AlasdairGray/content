    "description": "Core \u03b1 Mannosidase cleaves unbranched non-reducing terminal mannose, \u03b1(1-6) linked to the \u03b2-linked core mannose of the conserved mannosylchitobiose core of N-linked oligosaccharides. The presence of fucose linked to the core N-acetylglucosamine has no effect on cleavage.The enzyme may inhibit other mannosidases, such as \u03b1(1-2,3,6) mannosidase (E-AM01), if a noncleavable \u03b1(1-6) mannose is present on the substrate.
