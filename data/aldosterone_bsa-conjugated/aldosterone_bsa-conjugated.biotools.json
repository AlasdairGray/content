    "description": "Aldosterone is a steroid hormone (mineralocorticoid family) produced by the outer-section (zona glomerulosa) of the adrenal cortex in the adrenal gland to regulate sodium and potassium balance in the blood. It is synthesized from cholesterol by aldosterone synthase, which is absent in other sections of the adrenal gland. It acts in the kidney promoting the reabsorption of sodium ions (Na+) into the blood. Water follows the salt and this helps maintain normal blood pressure. It also acts on sweat glands to reduce the loss of sodium in perspiration and taste cells to increase the sensitivity of the taste buds to sources of sodium.",
