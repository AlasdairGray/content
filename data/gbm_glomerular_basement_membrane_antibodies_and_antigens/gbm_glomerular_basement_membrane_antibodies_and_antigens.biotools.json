    "description": "The glomerular basement membrane (GBM) is the extracellular matrix component of the selectively permeable glomerular filtration barrier (GFB) that separates the vasculature from the urinary space. The GBM lies between, and is initially synthesized by, the glomerular endothelial cells that line the glomerular capillaries and the podocytes (also called visceral epithelial cells) that sit on the opposite side of the GBM within the urinary space.",
