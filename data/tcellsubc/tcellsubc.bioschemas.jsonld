  "sc:description": "An Atlas of the Subcellular Proteome of Human T Cells.\n\nWe have curated an in-depth subcellular proteomic map of primary human CD4+ T cells, divided into cytosolic, nuclear and membrane fractions generated by an optimized fractionation and HiRIEF-LC-MS MS workflow for limited amounts of primary cells. The subcellular proteome of T cells was mapped under steady state conditions, as well as upon 15 min and 1 h of T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, respectively. We quantified the subcellular distribution of 6,572 proteins and identified a subset of 237 potentially translocating proteins, including both well-known examples and novel ones. Microscopic validation confirmed the localization of selected proteins with previously known and unknown localization, respectively.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Atlas' (bio.tools/atlas), 'HiRIEF-LC-MS'",
