    "description": "A class of disease that affects the lungs and other parts of the respiratory system. Currently, World Health Organisation estimates indicate that 235 million people worldwide suffer with asthma, 64 million with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and millions with allergic rhinitis. These respiratory diseases put a huge burden on individuals and society as the unmet medical need is substantial, with patients often remaining symptomatic for many years despite using the best available therapies.",
