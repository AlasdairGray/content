  "sc:description": "A comparison and assessment of computational method for identifying recombination hotspots in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\n\nMeiotic recombination is one of the most important driving forces in the process of biological evolution, which is initiated by double-stand DNA breaks (DSBs). Recombination has important roles in genome diversity and evolution. Based on dataset containing both ORF and non-ORF recombination sites, we construct a predictor called ‘iRSpot-Pse6NC2.0’ using SVM classifier by incorporating the key hexamer features into the general PseKNC (Pseudo K-tuple Nucleotide Composition) via the binomial distribution feature selection approach. The 5-fold cross-validated results showed that the maximum overall accuracy of 77.61%.\n\nMeiotic recombination caused by meiotic double-strand DNA breaks.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/RECIST_1.1 (PYTHONANYWHERE.COM), bio.tools/iPro70-FMWin (PYTHONANYWHERE.COM), bio.tools/camels (PYTHONANYWHERE.COM)",
