  "sc:description": "simple alignment tool for optical systems.\n\nBeamDelta is called from the command line using the following format:.\n\nA simple GUI interface for python-microscope which allows a compatible camera (see python-microscope compatibility list) to be used for optical alignment purposes. The GUI will display live images, calculate and mark beam centroids and then store an alignment centroid position. Once a position is stored the live centroid then displays a pixel based delta position to allow precise alignment between the marked position and the new beam.\n\nWe include a suggested parts list in BeamDelta-parts-list.csv which enables the construction of a two camera alignment setup. This hardware configuration will allow both lens alignment and co-aligning two beams and has a small footprint so can relatively easily be mounted within an existing setup",
