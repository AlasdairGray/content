                "abstract": "Motivation: The rational design of proteins with modified properties, through amino acid substitutions, is of crucial importance in a large variety of applications. Given the huge number of possible substitutions, every protein engineering project would benefit strongly from the guidance of in silico methods able to predict rapidly, and with reasonable accuracy, the stability changes resulting from all possible mutations in a protein. Results: We exploit newly developed statistical potentials, based on a formalism that highlights the coupling between four protein sequence and structure descriptors, and take into account the amino acid volume variation upon mutation. The stability change is expressed as a linear combination of these energy functions, whose proportionality coefficients vary with the solvent accessibility of the mutated residue and are identified with the help of a neural network. A correlation coefficient of R = 0.63 and a root mean square error of σc = 1.15 kcal/mol between measured and predicted stability changes are obtained upon cross-validation. These scores reach R = 0.79, and σc = 0.86 kcal/mol after exclusion of 10% outliers. The predictive power of our method is shown to be significantly higher than that of other programs described in the literature. © The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press.

                "title": "PoPMuSiC 2.1: A web server for the estimation of protein stability changes upon mutation and sequence optimality", 
                "abstract": "Background: The rational design of modified proteins with controlled stability is of extreme importance in a whole range of applications, notably in the biotechnological and environmental areas, where proteins are used for their catalytic or other functional activities. Future breakthroughs in medical research may also be expected from an improved understanding of the effect of naturally occurring disease-causing mutations on the molecular level.Results: PoPMuSiC-2.1 is a web server that predicts the thermodynamic stability changes caused by single site mutations in proteins, using a linear combination of statistical potentials whose coefficients depend on the solvent accessibility of the mutated residue. PoPMuSiC presents good prediction performances (correlation coefficient of 0.8 between predicted and measured stability changes, in cross validation, after exclusion of 10% outliers). It is moreover very fast, allowing the prediction of the stability changes resulting from all possible mutations in a medium size protein in less than a minute. This unique functionality is user-friendly implemented in PoPMuSiC and is particularly easy to exploit. Another new functionality of our server concerns the estimation of the optimality of each amino acid in the sequence, with respect to the stability of the structure. It may be used to detect structural weaknesses, i.e. clusters of non-optimal residues, which represent particularly interesting sites for introducing targeted mutations. This sequence optimality data is also expected to have significant implications in the prediction and the analysis of particular structural or functional protein regions. To illustrate the interest of this new functionality, we apply it to a dataset of known catalytic sites, and show that a much larger than average concentration of structural weaknesses is detected, quantifying how these sites have been optimized for function rather than stability.Conclusion: The freely available PoPMuSiC-2.1 web server is highly useful for identifying very rapidly a list of possibly relevant mutations with the desired stability properties, on which subsequent experimental studies can be focused. It can also be used to detect sequence regions corresponding to structural weaknesses, which could be functionally important or structurally delicate regions, with obvious applications in rational protein design. © 2011 Dehouck et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",
