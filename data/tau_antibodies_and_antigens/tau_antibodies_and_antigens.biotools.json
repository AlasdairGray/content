    "description": "Tau is a microtubule-associated protein found predominantly in neuronal axons of the vertebrate brain. Human tau exists as six different isoforms and the molecular weight of the tau isoforms ranges from 48 kDa to 68 kDa. Tau interacts with actin in the cytoskeleton and neuronal outgrowth, anchors enzymes such as protein kinases and phosphatases, and regulates intracellular vesicle transport.",
