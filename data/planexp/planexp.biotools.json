All rights reserved.Motivation: There is an increasing amount of transcriptomic and genomic data available for planarians with the advent of both traditional and single-cell RNA sequencing technologies. Therefore, exploring, visualizing and making sense of all these data in order to understand planarian regeneration and development can be challenging. Results: In this work, we present PlanExp, a web-application to explore and visualize gene expression data from different RNA-seq experiments (both traditional and single-cell RNA-seq) for the planaria Schmidtea mediterranea. PlanExp provides tools for creating different interactive plots, such as heatmaps, scatterplots, etc. and links them with the current sequence annotations both at the genome and the transcript level thanks to its integration with the PlanNET web application. PlanExp also provides a full gene/protein network editor, a prediction of genetic interactions from single-cell RNA-seq data, and a network expression mapper that will help researchers to close the gap between systems biology and planarian regeneration.",
