    "description": "CITE-sort is an artificial-cell-type aware surface marker clustering method for CITE-seq data. CITE-sort conducts auto-gating with CITE-seq ADT data using recursive Gaussian Mixture Model. It is robust against artificial cell types that stem from multiplets. CITE-sort also provides concrete explanations of its internal decision process by constructing a biologically meaningful sort tree. See our paper for more details.",

                "abstract": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press.Motivation: Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq), couples the measurement of surface marker proteins with simultaneous sequencing of mRNA at single cell level, which brings accurate cell surface phenotyping to single-cell transcriptomics. Unfortunately, multiplets in CITE-seq datasets create artificial cell types (ACT) and complicate the automation of cell surface phenotyping. Results: We propose CITE-sort, an artificial-cell-type aware surface marker clustering method for CITE-seq. CITE-sort is aware of and is robust to multiplet-induced ACT. We benchmarked CITE-sort with real and simulated CITE-seq datasets and compared CITE-sort against canonical clustering methods. We show that CITE-sort produces the best clustering performance across the board. CITE-sort not only accurately identifies real biological cell types (BCT) but also consistently and reliably separates multiplet-induced artificial-cell-type droplet clusters from real BCT droplet clusters. In addition, CITE-sort organizes its clustering process with a binary tree, which facilitates easy interpretation and verification of its clustering result and simplifies cell-type annotation with domain knowledge in CITE-seq.",
