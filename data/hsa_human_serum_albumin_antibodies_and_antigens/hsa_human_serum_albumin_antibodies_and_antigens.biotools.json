    "description": "Human serum albumin (HSA), the most abundant protein in human plasma, is a monomeric multi-domain macromolecule with a molecular weight of 66,437 Da. It is a soluble, globular, and unglycosylated monomeric protein that has many vital biological roles. It is mainly used as a vehicle for a host of small molecules and proteins, regulates oncotic pressure, and performs the majority of antioxidation in the body.",
