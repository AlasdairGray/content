  description: SIMD partial order alignment library (development files)
  long_description: " Spoa (SIMD POA) is a c++ implementation of the partial order\
    \ alignment\n (POA) algorithm (as described in 10.1093/bioinformatics/18.3.452)\
    \ which\n is used to generate consensus sequences (as described in\n 10.1093/bioinformatics/btg109).\
    \ It supports three alignment modes: local\n (Smith-Waterman), global (Needleman-Wunsch)\
    \ and semi-global alignment\n (overlap).\n .\n This package contains the static\
    \ library and the header files.\n"
