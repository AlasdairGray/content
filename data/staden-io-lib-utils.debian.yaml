  description: programs for manipulating DNA sequencing files
  long_description: " The io_lib from the Staden package is a library of file reading\
    \ and writing\n code to provide a general purpose trace file (and Experiment File)\
    \ reading\n interface. It has been compiled and tested on a variety of unix systems,\n\
    \ MacOSÂ X and MS Windows.\n .\n This package contains the programs that are distributed\
    \ with the Staden io_lib\n for manipulating and converting sequencing data files,\
    \ and in particular files\n to manipulate short reads generated by second and\
    \ third generation sequencers\n and stored in SRF format.\n"
