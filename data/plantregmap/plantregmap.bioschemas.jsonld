Users can select one of the three modes to retrieve regulations according to your requirement: 1) “TF (retrieve targets)” to retrieve the downstream targets of input TFs, 2) “Target (retrieve TFs)” to retrieve the upstream regulators of input genes, and 3) “Gene (retrieve regulations among them)” to retrieve the inside regulations among input genes",
