    "description": "Zetium Petro Edition XRF spectrometer can provide reliable element analysis, from crude oil to fuel and petrochemical products. The Petro Edition has been pre-configured to use appropriate hardware and compliance modules selected by user to produce compliance results, including factory pre-calibration based on international test methods. Innovative ED core options have been added, making it the only XRF system that can handle both WDXRF and EDXRF test methods on only one instrument. The ED core is able to detect unexpected elements in production samples while collecting spectrum simultaneously.",
