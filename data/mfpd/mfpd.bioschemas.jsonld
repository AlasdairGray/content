      "sc:description": "Robust, real-time generic detector based on a multi-feature probabilistic method.\n\nRobust, real-time event detection from physiological signals acquired during long-term ambulatory monitoring still represents a major challenge for highly-artifacted signals. In this paper, we propose an original and generic multi-feature probabilistic detector (MFPD) and apply it to real-time QRS complex detection under noisy conditions. The MFPD method calculates a binary Bayesian probability for each derived feature and makes a centralized fusion, using the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The method is evaluated on two ECG databases: 1) the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database from Physionet containing clean ECG signals, 2) a benchmark noisy database created by adding noise recordings of the MIT-BIH noise stress test database, also from Physionet, to the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
