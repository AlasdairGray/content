  "sc:description": "machine learning versus process-based models.\n\nIn-field wireless sensor network to predict rice blast.\n\nThe RICE-GUARD project will develop a wireless sensor network comprised of low-cost measurement nodes that will be capable of transmitting readings of the relevant in-field site-specific environmental variables in real-time to a central server.\n\nRice blast is the most serious disease of cultivated rice. It is caused by the fungus Magnaporthe grisea (Pyricularia oryzae Cav.), which in favourable conditions can produce yield losses of up to 100 %. Although rice blast is present wherever rice is cultivated, its intensity (incidence and severity of disease) is highly variable and depends on cropping system and climate.\n\nThe 3 year research project is funded by the European Commission and brings together 10 partners from 5 European countries.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'predicting rice blast disease', 'process-based', 'M5Rules', 'Yoshino'",
