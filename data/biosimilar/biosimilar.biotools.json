    "description": "Biosimilar is a biological product which is highly similar to another already approved biological medicine (reference product), and there is not any clinically meaningful difference between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, immunogenicity and efficacy of the product. Biosimilar includes soluble receptors, hormones, growth factors and monoclonal antibodies, etc. It is a complex issue to demonstrate that one biosimilar is interchangeable with the reference product.",
