  "sc:description": "a Comprehensive Plastics Microbial Biodegradation Database.\n\n&nbspPMBD: a Plastics Microbial Biodegradation Database.\n\nPlastics are produced in millions of tons each year. Most of them are discarded after a single use. Although plastics are generally considered as non-toxic to the environment, the sheer amount of plastic waste has caused significant burden to the environment. Fortunately, the plastic waste could be degraded slowly in nature, not only by the sunlight but also by the microorganisms. In this database, we collect the biodegradation relationships between microorganisms and plastics, along with the underlying mechanisms. Hopefully, this website will serve as a great tool for researchers who are working hard to solve the plastic waste problem",
