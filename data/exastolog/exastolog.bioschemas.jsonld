      "sc:description": "Exact calculation of stationary solution and parameter sensitivity analysis of stochastic continuous time Boolean models.\n\nAbstract Motivation Solutions to stochastic Boolean models are usually estimated by Monte Carlo simulations, but as the state space of these models can be enormous, there is an inherent uncertainty about the accuracy of Monte Carlo estimates and whether simulations have reached all asymptotic solutions. Moreover, these models have timescale parameters (transition rates) that the probability values of stationary solutions depend on in complex ways that have not been analyzed yet in the literature. These two fundamental uncertainties call for an exact calculation method for this class of models.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'exact stoch log mod', 'stationary', 'calculation', 'under-explored'",
