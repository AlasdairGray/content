  description: Python 3 bindings for libroadrunner
  long_description: " LibRoadRunner is a high performance and portable simulation\
    \ engine for\n systems and synthetic biology. I can run on many platforms including\n\
    \ Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. libRoadRunner is major rewrite of the\n original\
    \ C# roadRunner developed by Frank Bergmann and Herbert Sauro.\n The same original\
    \ functionality however remains, including the\n original C API, the structural\
    \ analysis code, sensitivity and steady\n state analyses, but with significant\
    \ improvements to performance, back-\n end design, better event handling, new\
    \ C++ API and stochastic\n simulation support.\n .\n This package contains the\
    \ Python 3 bindings for libroadrunner."
