  description: ridgeline-/joyplots plotting routine
  long_description: " JoyPy is a one-function Python package based on matplotlib +\
    \ pandas\n with a single purpose: drawing joyplots (a.k.a. ridgeline plots).\n\
    \ Joyplots are stacked, partially overlapping density plots.\n They are a nice\
    \ way to plot data to visually compare distributions,\n especially those that\
    \ change across one dimension (e.g., over time).\n Though hardly a new technique,\
    \ they have become very popular lately\n thanks to the R packages ggridges and\
    \ ggjoy.\n"
