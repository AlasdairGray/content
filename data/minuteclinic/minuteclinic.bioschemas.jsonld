      "sc:description": "IMPLEMENTING THE AGE-FRIENDLY HEALTH SYSTEM INTO CVSMINUTE CLINICS.\n\nAbstractEach day, 10,000 individuals in the United States turn 65 and nearly 30% of our nation’s 884 million ambulatory care visits involve patients ages 65 and older. With this trend, the use of convenient care settings for treatment for chronic conditions associated with aging such as diabetes and hypertension is emerging. The need for the delivery of age-friendly care in convenient care settings is essential to ensure high quality and safe care. CVS MinuteClinic® and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) will present the plan and preliminary findings for the extension of the IHI’s Age-Friendly Health Systems initiative into the CVS MinuteClinic.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE BROKEN!.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/Diffeomorphic (IC.OUP.COM).\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Age-Friendly', 'IHI Age-Friendly', 'Epic', 'Clinic'",
