The system is build on the wiki philosophy, all modifications to a certain gene are stored and can be found back in the annotation history of that gene. To be able to modify genes however you will need to have a user account. Anonymous users can browse the public genomes but don't have editing rights.\n\nNutrition is at the core of AOCC.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/limani (PSB.UGENT.BE), bio.tools/orcae (BIOINFORMATICS.PSB.UGENT.BE/orcae ; PSB.UGENT.BE/orcae), bio.tools/cornet_arabidopsis (PSB.UGENT.BE)",
