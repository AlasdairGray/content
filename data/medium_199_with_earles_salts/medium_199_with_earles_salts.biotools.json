    "description": "Balanced salts are a combination of inorganic salts and normally a carbohydrate. They act as buffer to protect cells from sharp fluctuations in pH while maintaining the proper osmotic pressure across the cell membrane. In a complete medium, balanced salts are essential to the growth and maintenance of cells in culture. Alone balanced salts are generally used as a cell rinsing fluid and for short-term maintenance while cells are manipulated outside a complete growth environment.",
