  "sc:description": "combining phylogenetic and network analyses for orthology assignment.\n\northology assignment using phylogenetic and network analyses.\n\nBroccoli, a user-friendly pipeline designed to infer with high precision orthologous groups and pairs of proteins using a phylogeny-based approach. Briefly, Broccoli performs ultra-fast phylogenetic analyses on most proteins and builds a network of orthologous relationships. Orthologous groups are then identified from the network using a parameter-free machine learning algorithm (label propagation). Broccoli is also able to detect chimeric proteins resulting from gene-fusion events and to assign these proteins to the corresponding orthologous groups",
