  "sc:description": "The Landscape of Circular RNA Expression in the Human Brain.\n\nThe landscape of circRNA expression in the human brain.\n\nGokool et al. Biological Psychiatry (2019).\n\nCircular RNAs (circRNAs) are enriched in the mammalian brain and are upregulated in response to neuronal differentiation and depolarisation. These RNA molecules, formed by non-canonical back-splicing, have both regulatory and translational potential. Here, we carried out an extensive characterisation of circRNA expression in the human brain, in nearly two hundred human brain samples, from both healthy individuals and autism cases.\n\n||| NAME EQUAL TO (PUB.
