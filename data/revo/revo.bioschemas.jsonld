      "sc:description": "Resampling of Ensembles by Variation Optimization.\n\nConventional molecular dynamics simulations are incapable of sampling many important interactions in biomolecular systems due to their high dimensionality and rough energy landscapes. To observe rare events and calculate transition rates in these systems, enhanced sampling is a necessity. In particular, the study of ligand-protein interactions necessitates a diverse ensemble of protein conformations and transition states, and for many systems this occurs on prohibitively long timescales. Previous strategies such as WExplore that can be used to determine these types of ensembles are hindered by problems related to the regioning of conformational space. Here we propose a novel, regionless, enhanced sampling method that is based on the weighted ensemble framework.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'trypsin-benzamidine', 'regionless'",
