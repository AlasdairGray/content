    "description": "The first Circovirus was described in 1974 (I. Tischer) as a contaminant of porcine kidney cells in culture, replicating best in PK15 cells. This virus was named Porcine Circovirus, or PCV. Since then, some similar viruses have been described that infect other species. As a group, these viruses are classified as the Circoviridae.Two variants of the porcine virus have been described-PCV1 and PCV2.",
