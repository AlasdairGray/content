For a genome-wide mixed-model association analysis, we introduce a barebones linear model fitting function called fastLmPure from the R RcppArmadillo package for the rapid estimation of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effects and the maximum likelihood values of factored spectrally transformed linear mixed models (FaST-LMM)",
