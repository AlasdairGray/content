  "sc:description": "A single- and multitask machine learning algorithm for the prediction of cancer driver genes.\n\nLOTUS is an algorithm for cancer driver gene prediction. This page provides in particular codes to reproduce simulation results.\n\nWe propose a new computational method called LOTUS to predict new driver genes. LOTUS is a machine-learning based approach which allows to integrate various types of data in a versatile manner, including information about gene mutations and protein-protein interactions. In addition, LOTUS can predict cancer driver genes in a pan-cancer setting as well as for specific cancer types, using a multitask learning strategy to share information across cancer types",
