  description: development files for the HTSlib
  long_description: " HTSlib is an implementation of a unified C library for accessing\
    \ common file\n formats, such as SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map), CRAM and VCF (Variant\
    \ Call\n Format), used for high-throughput sequencing data, and is the core library\n\
    \ used by samtools and bcftools. HTSlib only depends on zlib. It is known to be\n\
    \ compatible with gcc, g++ and clang.\n .\n HTSlib implements a generalized BAM\
    \ (binary SAM) index, with file extension\n ‘csi’ (coordinate-sorted index). The\
    \ HTSlib file reader first looks for the\n new index and then for the old if the\
    \ new index is absent.\n .\n This package contains development files for the HTSlib:\
    \ headers, static\n library, manual pages, etc.\n .\n For compatibility with sambamba,\
    \ the internal routine cram_to_bam was\n exported, hereto adopting a patch found\
    \ in guix.\n"
