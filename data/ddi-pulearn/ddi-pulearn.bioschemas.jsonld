  "sc:description": "a positive-unlabeled learning method for large-scale prediction of drug-drug interactions.\n\nBACKGROUND:Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a major concern in patients' medication. It's unfeasible to identify all potential DDIs using experimental methods which are time-consuming and expensive. Computational methods provide an effective strategy, however, facing challenges due to the lack of experimentally verified negative samples. RESULTS:To address this problem, we propose a novel positive-unlabeled learning method named DDI-PULearn for large-scale drug-drug-interaction predictions. DDI-PULearn first generates seeds of reliable negatives via OCSVM (one-class support vector machine) under a high-recall constraint and via the cosine-similarity based KNN (k-nearest neighbors) as well.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
