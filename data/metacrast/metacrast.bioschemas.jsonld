  "sc:description": "Reference-guided extraction of CRISPR spacers from unassembled metagenomes.\n\nMetaCRAST: reference-guided CRISPR detection in metagenomes.\n\nMetaCRAST (Metagenomic CRISPR Reference-Aided Search Tool) is a tool to detect CRISPR arrays in raw, unassembled metagenomes. Unlike other tools, it uses expected CRISPR direct repeat (DR) sequences from assembled contigs or bacterial genomes to guide metagenomic CRISPR detection. It uses a fast implementation of the Wu-Manber multipattern search algorithm to rapidly select reads that contain an expected DR sequence. It then proceeds through reads identified in the previous step to find DR sequences within acceptable distances of each other (i.e., with acceptable length spacers between them). Spacers between these DRs are then extracted and clustered into a non-redundant set with CD-HIT",
