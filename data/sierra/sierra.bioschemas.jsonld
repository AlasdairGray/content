  "sc:description": "Discovery of differential transcript usage from polyA-captured single-cell RNA-seq data.\n\nSierra is an R package designed for detecting differential transcript usage analysis from polyA-enriched single cell RNASeq data. Sierra identifies coordinates of read pileups (i.e. peaks) and performs UMI counting, followed by differential usage analysis between defined cell populations. Please read vignette for a demonstration on how to use this software",
