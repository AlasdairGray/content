      "sc:description": "a manually curated database for non-coding RNAs associated with metabolic syndrome.\n\nMetabolic syndrome is a cluster of the most dangerous heart attack risk factors (diabetes and raised fasting plasma glucose, abdominal obesity, high cholesterol and high blood pressure), and has become a major global threat to human health. A number of studies have demonstrated that hundreds of non-coding RNAs, including miRNAs and lncRNAs, are involved in metabolic syndrome-related diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, etc. However, these research results are distributed in a large number of literature, which is not conducive to analysis and use. There is an urgent need to integrate these relationship data between metabolic syndrome and non-coding RNA into a specialized database.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'biomed-bigdata'",
