  "sc:description": "Improved cortical boundary registration for locally distorted fMRI scans.\n\nAn MRI analysis toolbox, primarily for laminar analysis.\n\nIn order to protect your privacy, we only use cookies that are essential for the functioning of this website.\n\nMany of the functions for general fMRI preprocessing are wrappers for existing well-established neuroimaging tools. The wrappers should be seen as a consistent MATLAB command line interface to these functions, not as a reimplementation. A large part of these functions are written for my own convenience. A substantial part is new method development, mainly regarding laminar analysis.\n\nFrom this project root, run tvm_installLaminarAnalysisToolbox.m in MATLAB.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'RBR'",
