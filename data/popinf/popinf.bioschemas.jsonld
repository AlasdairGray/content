  "sc:description": "An approach for reproducibly visualizing and assigning population affiliation in genomic samples of uncertain origin.\n\nQuick inference of population history.\n\nPopInf is a method to infer the major population (or populations) ancestry of a sample or set of samples.\n\nBelow are steps for running PopInf. PopInf is incorporated into the workflow system snakemake. All necessary files and scripts are in this directory. There are instructions on preparing the reference panel in a folder called \"Reference_Panel\". There are also instructions on preparing the unknown samples in a folder called \"Unknown_Samples\"",
