These data are generated by several UK based resources in the Genome3D consortium: SCOP, CATH, SUPERFAMILY, Gene3D, FUGUE, THREADER, PHYRE.\n\nThe tool genome3d-api aims to make communicating with the Genome3D API as convenient as possible. However, since the API has been defined using OpenAPI standards, you should be able to point any OpenAPI compatible client to the following specification:",
