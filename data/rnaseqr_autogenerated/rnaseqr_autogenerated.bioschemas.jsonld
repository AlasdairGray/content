  "sc:description": "an R package for automated two-group RNA-Seq analysis workflow.\n\nThis R package is designed for case-control RNA-Seq analysis (two-group). There are six steps: \"RNASeqRParam S4 Object Creation\", \"Environment Setup\", \"Quality Assessment\", \"Reads Alignment & Quantification\", \"Gene-level Differential Analyses\" and \"Functional Analyses\". Each step corresponds to a function in this package. After running functions in order, a basic RNASeq analysis would be done easily.\n\n||| NAME (RNASeqR) SIMILAR TO (PUB.
