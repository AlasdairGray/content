                "abstract": "Nucleosomes, a basic structural unit of eukaryotic chromatin, play a significant role in regulating gene expression. We have developed a web tool based on DNA sequences known from empirical and theoretical studies to influence DNA bending and flexibility, and to exclude nucleosomes. NXSensor (available at http://www.sfu.ca/~ibajic/NXSensor/) finds nucleosome exclusion sequences, evaluates their length and spacing, and computes an 'accessibility score' giving the proportion of base pairs likely to be nucleosome-free. Application of NXSensor to the promoter regions of housekeeping (HK) genes and those of tissue-specific (TS) genes revealed a significant difference between the two classes of gene, the former being significantly more open, on average, particularly near transcription start sites (TSSs). NXSensor should be a useful tool in assessing the likelihood of nucleosome formation in regions involved in gene regulation and other aspects of chromatin function. Â© The Author 2006.
