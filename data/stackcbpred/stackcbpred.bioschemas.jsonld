  "sc:description": "A stacking based prediction of protein-carbohydrate binding sites from sequence.\n\nCarbohydrate-binding proteins play vital roles in many important biological processes. The study of these protein-carbohydrate interactions, at residue level, is useful in treating many critical diseases. Analyzing the local sequential environments of the binding and non-binding regions to predict the protein-carbohydrate binding sites is one of the challenging problems in molecular and computational biology. Existing experimental methods for identifying protein-carbohydrate binding sites are laborious and expensive. Thus, prediction of such binding sites, directly from sequences, using computational methods, can be useful to fast annotate the binding sites and guide the experimental process.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
