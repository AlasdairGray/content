MutExGenome is a database of Mutual Exclusive mutations in mutiple species | Welcome to CFEA (Cell-Free Epigenome Atlas) | The cell-free DNA (cfDNA) was shown to be a powerful tool for the noninvasive diagnosis of various diseases and accumulating evidence suggests large-scale epigenetic alterations such as cfDNA methylation (5mC), cfDNA hydroxymethylation (5hmC) and cfDNA nucleosome positioning (NP) can sensitively detect and classify cancers. The CFEA (Cell-Free Epigenome Atlas) data portal is the first database dedicated to human cell-free epigenomes",
