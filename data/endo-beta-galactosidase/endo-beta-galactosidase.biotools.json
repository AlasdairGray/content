    "description": "Endo-\u03b2-galactosidase cleaves internal \u03b2(1-4) galactose linkages in unbranched, repeating poly-N-acetyllactosamine structures. Sulfated structures such as keratan sulfate are also cleaved. Branching and/or fucosylation of the substrate may decrease or eliminate cleavage.Endo-\u03b2-Galactosidase is useful for identifying and removing poly-N-acetyllactosamine structures on many biologically important glycoconjugates.",
