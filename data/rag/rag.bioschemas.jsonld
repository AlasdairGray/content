  "sc:description": "> HOMEPAGE BROKEN! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'RAG-Web' | RNA Structure Prediction/Design using RNA-As-Graphs | MOTIVATION:We launch a webserver for RNA structure prediction and design corresponding to tools developed using our RNA-As-Graphs (RAG) approach. RAG uses coarse-grained tree graphs to represent RNA secondary structure, allowing the application of graph theory to analyze and advance RNA structure discovery. Our webserver consists of three modules: (a) RAG Sampler: samples tree graph topologies from an RNA secondary structure to predict corresponding tertiary topologies, (b) RAG Builder: builds three-dimensional atomic models from candidate graphs generated by RAG Sampler, and (c) RAG Designer: designs sequences that fold onto novel RNA motifs (described by tree graph topologies). Results analyses are performed for further assessment selection. The Results page provides links to download results and indicates possible errors encountered",
