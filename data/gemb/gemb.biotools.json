    "description": "This method introduces gene set enrichment for mathematical biology (GEMB).  Typically, gene-set analyses measure the association between a disease of interest and a set of genes related to a biological pathway. These analyses often incorporate gene network properties to account for differential contributions of each gene. With GEMB, we extend this concept further, defining gene contributions based on biophysical properties, by leveraging mathematical models of biology to predict the effects of genetic perturbations on a particular downstream function.",
