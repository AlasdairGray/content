      "sc:description": "A Digital Platform for Workforce Development.\n\nOBJECTIVES SPECIFIC AIMS: The DIAMOND project encourages study team workforce development through the creation of a digital learning space that brings together resources from across the CTSA consortium. This allows for widespread access to and dissemination of training and assessment materials. DIAMOND also includes access to an ePortfolio that encourages CRPs to define career goals and document professional skills and training. METHODS STUDY POPULATION: Four CTSA institutions (the University of Michigan, the Ohio State University, University of Rochester, and Tufts CTSI) collaborated to develop and implement the DIAMOND portal. The platform is structured around eight competency domains, making it easy for users to search for research training and assessment materials.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| NAME (DIAMOND) SIMILAR TO (PUB. DIFFERENT) bio.tools/diamond (Diamond).\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE '3143 DIAMOND', 'ePortfolio'",
