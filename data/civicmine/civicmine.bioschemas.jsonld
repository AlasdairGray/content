CIViC catalogs information on diagnostic, predictive, predisposing and prognostic variants in cancer. This project aims to text mine this data from PubMed and Pubmed Central Open Access subset.\n\nDisclaimer: All information has been text-mined automatically. Therefore, you should evaluate the original papers that CIViCmine cites before making any interpretation.\n\nIn brief: it finds sentences that describe genes, variants, cancer types and optionally drugs.\n\ngit clone https://github.com/jakelever/civicmine.git.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/satellog (BCGSC.CA)",
