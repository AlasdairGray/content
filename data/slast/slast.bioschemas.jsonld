  "sc:description": "Simple Local Alignment Search Tool.\n\nAbstract We present a local alignment search tool not based on the usual strategy of seed and grow often employed for these tools. Instead, we just find regions in the database sequences having a high density of seed matches and then we perform a Smith-Waterman local alignment of the query sequence into these regions. This approach has some advantages for some use cases.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
