      "sc:description": "high accuracy imputation in full-sib families from genotype-by-sequencing data.\n\nAlphaFamImpute is a genotype calling, phasing, and imputation algorithm for large full-sib families in diploid plants and animals which supports individuals genotyped with SNP array or GBS data. The approach draws heavily on single and multi-locus iterative peeling (as in AlphaPeel). It also has been inspired by work outside our group such as hs-phase (Ferdosi et al. 2014), and magicimpute (Zheng et al. 2018). AlphaFamImpute was written by Andrew Whalen, and is currently being supported by Andrew Whalen and Steve Thorn.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/heat_seq (ROSLIN.ED.AC.UK)",
