  "sc:description": "Novel algorithms for efficient subsequence searching and mapping in nanopore raw signals towards targeted sequencing.\n\nHere we proposed two novel algorithms, the Direct Subsequence Dynamic Time Warping for nanopore raw signal search (DSDTWnano) and the continuous wavelet Subsequence DTW for nanopore raw signal search (cwSDTWnano), to enable the direct subsequence inquiry and exact mapping in the nanopore raw signal datasets. The proposed algorithms are based on â€¦.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'nanopore', 'AVAILABILITY:The', 'inquiry', 'PCR-freeness'",
