  long_description: " PBJelly is a highly automated pipeline that aligns long sequencing\n\
    \ reads (such as PacBio RS reads or long 454 reads in fasta format)\n to high-confidence\
    \ draft assembles. PBJelly fills or reduces as\n many captured gaps as possible\
    \ to produce upgraded draft genomes.\n .\n PBJelly is part of the PBSuite.\n"
