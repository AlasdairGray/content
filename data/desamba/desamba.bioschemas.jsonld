  "sc:description": "fast and accurate classification of metagenomics long reads with sparse approximate matches | DeSAMBA(de Bruijn graph-based Sparse Approximate Match Block Analyzer) is a tailored long read classification approach using a novel sparse approximate match-based pseudo alignment algorithm. Benchmarks on real datasets demonstrate that deSAMBA enables to simultaneously achieve fast speed and good classification yields, which outperforms state-of-the-art tools and has many potentials to cutting-edge metagenomics studies",
