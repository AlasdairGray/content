      "sc:description": "An Efficient Feature Extraction Technique Based on Local Coding PSSM and Multifeatures Fusion for Predicting Protein-Protein Interactions.\n\nBackground:Increasing evidence has indicated that protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play important roles in various aspects of the structural and functional organization of a cell. Thus, continuing to uncover potential PPIs is an important topic in the biomedical domain. Although various feature extraction methods with machine learning approaches have enhanced the prediction of PPIs. There remains room for improvement by developing novel and effective feature extraction methods and classifier approaches to identify PPIs. Method:In this study, we proposed a sequence-based feature extraction method called LCPSSMMF, which combined local coding position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) with multifeatures fusion.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE BROKEN!",
