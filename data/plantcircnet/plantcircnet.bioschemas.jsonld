  "sc:description": "a database for plant circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks.\n\n2017-07-18: Triticum aestivum added.\n\n2017-07-13: Parent gene link added.\n\n2016-10-16: PlantCircNet website construction finished.\n\nPlantCircNet is the first database that provides plant circRNA-miRNA-gene regulatory networks, as well as circRNA information and circRNA expression profiles. It provides convenient search functions for circRNA-associated regulatory networks, and enables users to retrieve regulatory interactions of interest by circRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs across eight model species. Sequences search is also avaliable. And an enrichment analysis tool has been provided for Gene Ontology categories of miRNA targets",
