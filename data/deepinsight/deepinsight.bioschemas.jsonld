  "sc:description": "a general framework for interpreting wide-band neural activity.\n\nDeepInsight is a toolbox for the analysis and interpretation of wide-band neural activity and can be applied on unsorted neural data. This means the traditional step of spike-sorting can be omitted and the raw data can be used directly as input, providing a more objective way of measuring decoding performance",
