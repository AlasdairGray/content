    "description": "VLX600 is a small molecule which is cytotoxic to quiescent cells in colon cancer cells with an IC\u2085\u2080 of 1-10 \u03bcM. VLX600 decreases mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and shows enhanced cytotoxic activity under conditions of nutrient starvation. It inhibits growth of colon cancer xenografts with minimal systemic toxicity in mice.",
