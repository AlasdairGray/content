      "sc:description": "A Circulating miRNA-Based Scoring System Established by WGCNA to Predict Colon Cancer.\n\nIntroduction:Circulation microRNAs (miRNAs) perform as potential diagnostic biomarkers of many kinds of cancers. This study is aimed at identifying circulation miRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers in colon cancer. Methods:We conducted a weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) in miRNAs to find out the expression pattern among circulation miRNAs by using a \"WGCNA\" package in R. Correlation analysis was performed to find cancer-related modules. Differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRs) in colon cancer were identified by a \"limma\" package in R. Hub gene analysis was conducted for these DEmiRs in the cancer-related modules by the \"closeness\" method in cytoscape software.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'WGCNA' (bio.tools/wgcna)",
