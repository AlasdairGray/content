  "sc:description": "a web service for the complete process of ChIP-Seq analysis.\n\nBACKGROUND:Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) is a technology that combines chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with next generation of sequencing technology (NGS) to analyze protein interactions with DNA. At present, most ChIP-seq analysis tools adopt the command line, which lacks user-friendly interfaces. Although some web services with graphical interfaces have been developed for ChIP-seq analysis, these sites cannot provide a comprehensive analysis of ChIP-seq from raw data to downstream analysis. RESULTS:In this study, we develop a web service for the whole process of ChIP-Seq Analysis (CSA), which covers mapping, quality control, peak calling, and downstream analysis. In addition, CSA provides a customization function for users to define their own workflows.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| NAME EQUAL TO (PUB. DIFFERENT) bio.tools/csa",
