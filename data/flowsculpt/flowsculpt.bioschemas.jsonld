  "sc:description": "software for efficient design of inertial flow sculpting devices | Computational Physics and Mechanics Laboratory, Iowa State University | Flowsculpt is an open-source utility for solving the inverse problem in pillar programming. That is, given a fluid flow shape, what is the pillar sequence and inlet design that will produce such a shape? Our utility uses a customizable genetic algorithm to determine optimal pillar sequence and inlet flow design for a given fluid flow shape. Flowsculpt currently runs on Windows, Linux, and OS X operating systems, with minimal dependencies, and is freely available here:",
