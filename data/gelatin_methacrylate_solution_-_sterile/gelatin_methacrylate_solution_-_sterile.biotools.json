    "description": "Gelatin methacrylate (gelMA) is a popular material in bioprinting due to its mechanical properties and printability. However, methacrylating gelatin in lab is an inconveniently time-consuming process. In addition, buying lyophilized GelMA to make it into the desired w/v concentration and sterile-filtering it in lab is extremely cumbersome and inefficient.Our pre-sterilized Gelatin Methacrylate is the best GelMA for 3D bioprinting. The 20% w/v solution comes as 1.5mL preloaded in a 5 mL syringe that is easily mixed with a cell suspension and photoinitiator.",
