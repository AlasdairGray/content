Here, we will address the cases where both location and time of observation are registered, and relevant for the analysis of the data. The Spatial and TimeSeries task views shed light on spatial, and temporal data handling and analysis, individually.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'tracking', 'movement-ecology', 'movement', 'render'",
