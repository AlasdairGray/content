  "sc:description": "Navigating through the r packages for movement.\n\nHandling and Analyzing Spatio-Temporal Data.\n\nAlthough one could argue that all data are spatio-temporal, as they must have been taken somewhere and at some point in time, in many cases the spatial locations or times of observation are not registered, and irrelevant to the purpose of the study. Here, we will address the cases where both location and time of observation are registered, and relevant for the analysis of the data. The Spatial and TimeSeries task views shed light on spatial, and temporal data handling and analysis, individually.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'tracking', 'movement-ecology', 'movement', 'render'",
