    "description": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus that can lead to a condition in which the immune system begins to fail, leading to opportunistic infections. HIV primarily infects vital cells in the human immune system such as helper T cells(specifically CD4+ T cells), macrophages and dendritic cells. HIV infection leads to low levels of CD4+ T cells through three main mechanisms: firstly, direct viral killing of infected cells; secondly, increased rates of apoptosis in infected cells; and thirdly, killing of infected CD4+ T cells by CD8 cytotoxic lymphocytes that recognize infected cells.",
