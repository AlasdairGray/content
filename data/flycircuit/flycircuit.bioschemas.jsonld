For more details, please read the associated manuscript -- \"Three-dimensional reconstruction of brain-wide wiring networks in Drosophila at single-cell resolution\" (Current Biology 2011, 21(1), pp.1-11). Registration is only necessary for users who want to up/download data or activate 3D viewer to view more than 5 images.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'FlyCircuit v1.2'",
