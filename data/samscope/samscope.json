    "description": "Lightweight SAM/BAM file viewer that makes visually exploring NGS data intuitively. It uses multiple layers to simultaneously (or sequentially) view SAM/BAM related features like coverage or allele frequency, or ChIP-SEQ features like polarity from as many files as you like. The paging-friendly binary file layout makes it feasible to browse data sets far larger than the system's available RAM.",

                "abstract": "Existing SAM visualization tools like 'samtools tview' (Li et al., 2009) are limited to a small region of the genome, and tools like Tablet (Milne et al., 2010) are limited to a relatively small number of reads and may fail outright on large datasets. We need to visualize complex ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq features such as polarity as well as coverage across whole 3 Gbp genomes such as Human. We have addressed these problems in a lightweight visualization system called SAMSCOPE accelerated by OpenGL. The extensive pre-processing and fast OpenGL interface of SAMSCOPE provides instantaneous and intuitive browsing of complex data at all levels of detail across multiple experiments.
