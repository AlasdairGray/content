      "sc:description": "A Graph-Based Algorithm to Analyze Dynamic H-Bond Networks in Membrane Proteins.\n\nMembrane proteins that function as transporters or receptors must communicate with both sides of the lipid bilayer in which they sit. This long distance communication enables transporters to move protons or other ions and small molecules across the bilayer and receptors to transmit an external signal to the cell. Hydrogen bonds, hydrogen-bond networks, and lipid-protein interactions are essential for the motions and functioning of the membrane protein and, consequently, of outmost interest to structural biology and numerical simulations. We present here Bridge, an algorithm tailored for efficient analyses of hydrogen-bond networks in membrane transporter and receptor proteins.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| NAME (Bridge) SIMILAR TO (PUB.
