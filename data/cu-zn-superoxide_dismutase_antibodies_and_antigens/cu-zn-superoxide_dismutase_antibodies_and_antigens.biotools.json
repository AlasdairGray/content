    "description": "Superoxide Dismutases (SODs) are a unique family of metalloproteins that catalyze the dismutation of superoxide anion radicals to oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. SOD is ubiquitous in oxygen metabolizing cells protecting these cells against direct and indirect oxygen-mediated free radical damage. Four types of SOD have been defined: Mn SOD,  Cu/Zn SOD (mainly present in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells), Fe SOD and extracellular (EC SOD).",
