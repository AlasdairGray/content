    "description": "Our services rely on combinatorial strategies of global genome engineering for custom pathway expression optimization. We are capable of generating large combinatorial libraries and designing the most suitable screening assays based on liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, or high-throughput methods, such as FACS or positive growth selection, that facilitated with biosensors.",
