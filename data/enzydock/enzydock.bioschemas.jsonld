  "sc:description": "> HOMEPAGE MISSING! | Protein-Ligand Docking of Multiple Reactive States along a Reaction Coordinate in Enzymes | Enzymes play a pivotal role in all biological systems. These biomachines are the most effective catalysts known, dramatically enhancing the rate of reactions by more than 10 orders of magnitude relative to the uncatalyzed reactions in solution. Predicting the correct, mechanistically appropriate binding modes for substrate and product, as well as all reaction intermediates and transition states, along a reaction pathway is immensely challenging and remains an unsolved problem. In the present work, we developed an effective methodology for identifying probable binding modes of multiple ligand states along a reaction coordinate in an enzyme active site",
