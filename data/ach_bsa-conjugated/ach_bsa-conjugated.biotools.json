    "description": "The chemical compound Acetylcholine, often abbreviated as ACh, was the first neurotransmitter to be identified. It is a chemical transmitter in the central nervous system (CNS) as well as in the parasympathetic nervous system in many organisms including humans. When it binds to Acetylcholine receptors of muscle fibers, stimulates those fibers to contract. Acetylcholine is also used in the brain, where it tends to cause excitatory actions.",
