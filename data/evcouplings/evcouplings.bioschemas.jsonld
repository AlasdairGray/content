If you want to run the evcouplings application (alignment generation, model parameter inference, structure prediction, etc.) you will also need to follow the sections on installing external tools and databases.\n\nPredict protein structure, function and mutations using evolutionary sequence covariation.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'ecolicomplex'",
