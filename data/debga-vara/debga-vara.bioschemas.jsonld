VARA is a variation-aware read global alignment algorithm. We developed deBGA-VARA by integrating VARA into deBGA. It is suitable for aligning various kinds of high-throughput sequencing reads to multiple similar reference genomes.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'deBGA-VARA available', 'VARA'",
