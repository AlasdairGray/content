  description: numerical representation of differences between strings
  long_description: " A small Python module providing edit distance (aka Levenshtein\
    \ distance,\n that is, counting insertions, deletions and substitutions) and Hamming\n\
    \ distance computation.\n .\n Its main purpose is to speed up computation of edit\
    \ distance by allowing\n to specify a maximum number of differences maxdiff (banding).\
    \ If that\n parameter is provided, the returned edit distance is anly accurate\
    \ up\n to maxdiff. That is, if the actual edit distance is higher than maxdiff,\n\
    \ a value larger than maxdiff is returned, but not necessarily the actual\n edit\
    \ distance.\n"
