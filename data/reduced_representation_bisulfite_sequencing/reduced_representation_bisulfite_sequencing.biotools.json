    "description": "CD Genomics is offering reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) service at single-nucleotide resolution by reducing the amount of sequencing required while capturing the majority of promoters and other relevant genomic regions. RRBS is favorable for biomarker discovery by the identification and analysis of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between samples.",
