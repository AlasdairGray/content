OBJECTIVE:We explored the application of the Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network to identify positive circumferential resection margins in high-resolution MRI images. DESIGN AND SETTINGS:This was a retrospective study conducted at a single surgical unit of a public university hospital.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'circumferential resection', 'circumferential resection margin', 'circumferential', 'resection margin'",
