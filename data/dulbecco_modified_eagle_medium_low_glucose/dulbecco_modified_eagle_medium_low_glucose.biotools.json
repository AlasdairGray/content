    "description": "Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium, High Glucose (DME/HIGH) contains a four-fold increase in the concentration of amino acids and vitamins found in Eagle\u2019s Basal Medium (BME). DME media were originally developed to be used with a serum supplement in a 10% C02 atmosphere for the cultivation of non-transformed mouse and chicken cells. DMEM and its modifications are widely used to support the growth of a broad spectrum of mammalian cells.",
