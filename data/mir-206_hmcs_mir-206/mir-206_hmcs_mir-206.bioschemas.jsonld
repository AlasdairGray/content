  "sc:description": "miR-206 Inhibits Cell Proliferation and Extracellular Matrix Accumulation by Targeting Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1-alpha (HIF-1Î±) in Mesangial Cells Treated with High Glucose.\n\nBACKGROUND The goal of this study was to investigate the expression of miR-206 in human glomerular mesangial cells (hMCs) treated by exposure to high glucose (HG) levels, to assess the influence of miR-206 on the proliferation and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition of hMCs, and to investigate the potential mechanisms of action. MATERIAL AND METHODS The level of miR-206 was detected by RT-qPCR. MTT assay and colony formation assay were used to assess hMCs cell proliferation ability. Western blotting was carried out to measure the expression of related proteins.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'hMCs miR-206', 'miR-206 hMCs', 'miR-206 mimics miR-206', 'regulated miR-206 hMCs miR-206'",
