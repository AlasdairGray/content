      "sc:description": "A Python Framework for Multi-Components Synchronous Analysis of Spectral Imaging.\n\nSpectral imaging is of visualization, high precision, and high sensitivity, and suitable for analyzing the spatial distribution of complex materials. While providing rich and detailed information, it makes higher demands on feature extraction and information mining of high-dimensional data. For the convenience of further utilization, our research team has developed a python framework for the multi-component synchronous analysis of spectral imaging based on characteristic band method and fast-NNLS algorithm, helping to handle spectrum data from complex samples and gaining semi-quantitative information of the sample on the scale of pixel based on target components.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'fast-NNLS', 'multi-space', 'Multi-Components'",
