    "description": "Feline panleukopenia virus (FPV)  is a highly contagious, severe infection that causes gastrointestinal, immune system, and nervous system disease. It is closely related to mink enteritis virus and the type 2 canine parvoviruses (CPV) that cause canine parvoviral enteritis. The genome of FPV is a single-stranded DNA molecule that requires split S-phase cells to replicate, so viral growth is restricted to mitotically active tissues.",
