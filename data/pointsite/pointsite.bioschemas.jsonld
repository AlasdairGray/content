      "sc:description": "a point cloud segmentation tool for identification of protein ligand binding atoms.\n\nAbstract Accurate identifications of ligand binding sites (LBS) on protein structure is critical for understanding protein function and designing structure-based drug. As the previous pocket-centric methods are usually based on the investigation of pseudo surface points (PSPs) outside the protein structure, thus inherently cannot incorporate the local connectivity and global 3D geometrical information of the protein structure. In this paper, we propose a novel point clouds segmentation method, PointSite, for accurate identification of protein ligand binding atoms, which performs protein LBS identification at the atom-level in a protein-centric manner. Specifically, we first transfer the original 3D protein structure to point clouds and then conduct segmentation through Submanifold Sparse Convolution (SSC) based U-Net.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/pymzml (GITHUB.COM)",
