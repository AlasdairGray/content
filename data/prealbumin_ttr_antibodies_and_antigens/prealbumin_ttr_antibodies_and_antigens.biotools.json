    "description": "Prealbumin, known as transthyretin (TTR), is synthesized primarily in the liver and acts as a binding protein for thyroid hormones and retinol-binding protein. It also acts as a biochemical marker to assess the capacity of the liver, malnutrition as well as the efficacy of parenteral nutrition due to those 4 reasons: 2-days short serum half-life; Less affected by liver disease than other proteins; Not affected by hydration status; Not affected by Vitamin Deficiency (except zinc).",
