      "sc:description": "AlphaTracker is a multi-animal tracking and behavioral analysis tool which incorporates multi-animal tracking, pose estimation and unsupervised behavioral clustering to empower system neuroscience research. Alphatracker achieves the state-of-art accuracy of multi-animal tracking which lays the foundation for stringent biological studies. Moreover, the minimum requirement for hardware (regular webcams) and efficient training procedure allows readily adoption by most neuroscience labs.",
