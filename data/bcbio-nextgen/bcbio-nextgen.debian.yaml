description: This package installs the command line tools of the bcbio-nextgen toolkit
  implementing best-practice pipelines for fully automated high throughput sequencing
  analysis. . A high-level configuration file specifies inputs and analysis parameters
  to drive a parallel pipeline that handles distributed execution, idempotent processing
  restarts and safe transactional steps. The project contributes a shared community
  resource that handles the data processing component of sequencing analysis, providing
  researchers with more time to focus on the downstream biology.
