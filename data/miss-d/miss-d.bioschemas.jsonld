      "sc:description": "A fast and scalable framework of medical image storage service based on distributed file system.\n\nBackground and Objective Processing of medical imaging big data is deeply challenging due to the size of data, computational complexity, security storage and inherent privacy issues. Traditional picture archiving and communication system, which is an imaging technology used in the healthcare industry, generally uses centralized high performance disk storage arrays in the practical solutions. The existing storage solutions are not suitable for the diverse range of medical imaging big data that needs to be stored reliably and accessed in a timely manner. The economical solution is emerging as the cloud computing which provides scalability, elasticity, performance and better managing cost. Cloud based storage architecture for medical imaging big data has attracted more and more attention in industry and academia.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'framework'",
