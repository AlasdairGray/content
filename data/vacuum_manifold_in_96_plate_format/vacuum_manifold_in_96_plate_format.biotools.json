    "description": "The Ludger-Velocity SPE vacuum manifold system is a 96 well microplate format system which enables analysts to process up to 96 samples simultaneously. The system can be used with individual clean up cartridges (e.g. LC-T1-A6 or LC-A-24) or 96 well plate clean up devices (e.g. LC-EXO-96, LC-PBM-96, LC-PROC-96 or LC-PERMET-96).Use of a vacuum manifold for sample clean up speeds up processing times. Ludger's Velocity vacuum manifold system is compatible with cartridges or plates, and is a valuable tool for your lab.",
