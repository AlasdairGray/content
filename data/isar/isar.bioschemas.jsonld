      "sc:description": "new synthesis platform for radiopharmaceutical production.\n\nBACKGROUND:PET radiopharmaceutical development and the implementation of a production method on a synthesis module is a complex and time-intensive task since new synthesis methods must be adapted to the confines of the synthesis platform in use. Commonly utilized single fluid bus architectures put multiple constraints on synthesis planning and execution, while conventional microfluidic solutions are limited by compatibility at the macro-to-micro interface. In this work we introduce the ISAR synthesis platform and custom-tailored fluid paths leveraging up to 70 individually addressable valves on a chip-based consumable.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'development', 'implementation ISAR', '13NNH3', 'consumable', 'radiopharmaceutical'",
