      "sc:description": "Post-Translational Modifications Mass Spectrometry Calculator is a free web application that simplifies mass spectrometry calculations for post-translationally modified (PTM) proteins. The application is able to calculate: a) the kind, the number and the combinations of  possible PTMs for a  peptide or protein sequence and the corresponding mass, b) the charge of a peptide, protein or protein fragment in  their modified or  unmodified state, c) the protein fragments produced upon proteolytic cleavage of PTM modified proteins and their masses. A particular focus is on PTM-modified histones. A histone variant browser is included in the web application. It could be useful in analysis of mass-spec data for epigenetically  modified histones and other proteins.",
