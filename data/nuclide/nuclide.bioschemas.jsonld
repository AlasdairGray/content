      "sc:description": "A C++ module to include DDEP recommended radioactive decay Data in Geant4.\n\nThis article describes the Nuclide++ module developed at LNE-LNHB to simulate the decay schemes related to single or multiple radionuclides, by randomly selecting decay pathways. Written in C++, with respect of the Geant4 coding style, this module can be used transparently in Geant4-based simulation applications as an alternative to the existing Radioactive Decay Module (RDM). Nuclide++ takes advantage of the DDEP recommended data, accurate Î²-emitting spectra calculation and detailed description of the atomic rearrangement. This module can be useful in many applications, especially those involving radioactive sources. The reliability of the module was verified through comparisons with a while chosen radionuclides.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
