It is designed to align long sequencing reads (such as those from PacBio circular consensus sequencing) to targets, filter these alignments based on user-provided specifications, and parse out user-defined sequence features. For each read that passes the filters, information about the features (e.g. accuracy, sequence, mutations) is retained for further analyses.\n\nalignparse is a Python package written by the Bloom lab.
