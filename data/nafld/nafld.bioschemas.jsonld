  "sc:description": "A 2-step fast-track elastometry service for advanced workup of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients.\n\nINTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasing globally with an estimated prevalence of approximately 25 %. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis as the progressive disease entity often leads to fibrosis and end-stage disease. The magnitude of NAFLD patients are not diagnosed and have no access to further clinical assessment. Diagnostic pathways for individual risk evaluation fitting with available resources are of utmost importance in real-world clinical practice. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 1346 anonymized outpatient datasets at WÃ¼rzburg University Hospital, Germany. Transient elastography (TE) with controlled attenuation parameter and laboratory-based risk scores (NFS, FIB-4) were the main diagnostic workup tools for risk stratification.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
