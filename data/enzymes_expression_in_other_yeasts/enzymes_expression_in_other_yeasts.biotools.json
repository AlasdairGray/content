    "description": "It has become evident that the compatibility of the host's biochemical environment with the ability to process and translate the RNA transcript, along with its ability to modify and sustain the translated protein are equally important in choosing the most appropriate host cell for protein expression. In addition to the most common expression system such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris, several other yeast expression systems are under development. The most popular yeast stains include Arxula adeninivorans, Kluyveromyces lactis, Yarrowia lipolytica, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe showing unique advantages that the typical expression systems do not offer. Therefore, to facilitate the pioneering and early-stage research, Creative Enzymes provides enzyme expression services in these yeast systems.",
