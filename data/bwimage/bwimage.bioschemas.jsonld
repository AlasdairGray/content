'bwimage' implemented functions for exceptionally broad subject. For instance, 'bwimage' provide examples that range from calculation of canopy openness, description of patterns in vertical vegetation structure, to patterns in bird nest structure.\n\nThe facility to obtain high quality digital images creates the opportunity to measure natural variables using image analyses. Bwimage is an R package to analyze patterns in black and white images from natural structures.\n\nA computational tool to describe patterns from black and white images",
