PRALINE provides various MSA optimisation strategies including weighted global and local profile pre-processing, secondary structure-guided alignment and a reliability measure for aligned individual residue positions. The latter can also be used to optimise the alignment when the profile pre-processing strategies are iterated. In addition, we have modelled the server output to enable comprehensive visualisation of the generated alignment and easy figure generation for publications. The alignment is represented in five default colour schemes based on: residue type, position conservation, position reliability, residue hydrophobicity and secondary structure; depending on the options set. We have also implemented a custom colour scheme that allows the user to select which colour will represent one or more amino acids in the alignment. The grouping of sequences, on which the alignment is based, can also be visualised as a dendrogram. The PRALINE algorithm is designed to work more as a toolkit for MSA rather than a one step process.",

We have added a number of new functionalities by both providing more structure parameters to the STING Database and by improving/expanding the interface for enhanced data handling. The integration among the STING components has also been improved. A new key feature is the ability of the STING server to handle local files containing protein structures (either modeled or not yet deposited to the Protein Data Bank) so that they can be used by the principal STING components: JavaProtein Dossier (J PD) and STING Report. The current capabilities of the new STING version and a couple of biologically relevant applications are described here. We have provided an example where Diamond STING identifies the active site amino acids and folding essential amino acids (both previously determined by experiments) by filtering out all but those residues by selecting the numerical values/ranges for a set of corresponding parameters. This is the fundamental step toward a more interesting endeavor - the prediction of such residues.

In addition to a number of available alignment strategies, PRALINE can integrate information from database homology searches to generate a homology-extended multiple alignment. PRALINE also provides a choice of seven different secondary structure prediction programs that can be used individually or in combination as a consensus for integrating structural information into the alignment process. The program can be used through two separate interfaces: one has been designed to cater to more advanced needs of researchers in the field, and the other for standard construction of high confidence alignments. The web-based output is designed to facilitate the comprehensive visualization of the generated alignments by means of five default colour schemes based on: residue type, position conservation, position reliability, residue hydrophobicity and secondary structure, depending on the options set. A user can also define a custom colour scheme by selecting which colour will represent one or more amino acids in the alignment. All generated alignments are also made available in the PDF format for easy figure generation for publications. The grouping of sequences, on which the alignment is based, can also be visualized as a dendrogram.

For each of the alignment sequences, the putative homologous sequences that score above a pre-defined threshold are incorporated into a position-specific pre-alignment profile. The enriched position-specific profile is used for standard progressive alignment, thereby more accurately describing the characteristic features of the given sequence set. We show that owing to the incorporation of the pre-alignment information into a standard progressive multiple alignment routine, the alignment quality between distant sequences increases significantly and outperforms state-of-the-art methods, such as T-COFFEE and MUSCLE. We also show that although entirely sequence-based, our novel strategy is better at aligning distant sequences when compared with a recent contact-based alignment method. Therefore, our pre-alignment profile strategy should be advantageous for applications that rely on high alignment accuracy such as local structure prediction, comparative modelling and threading. © The Author 2005.

                "abstract": "Efforts to use computers in predicting the secondary structure of proteins based only on primary structure information started over a quarter century ago [1-3]. Although the results were encouraging initially, the accuracy of the pioneering methods generally did not attain the level required for using predictions of secondary structures reliably in modelling the three-dimensional topology of proteins. During the last decade, however, the introduction of new computational techniques as well as the use of multiple sequence information has lead to a dramatic increase in the success rate of prediction methods, such that successful 3D modelling based on predicted secondary structure has become feasible [e.g., Ref 4]. This review is aimed at presenting an overview of the scale of the secondary structure prediction problem and associated pitfalls, as well as the history of the development of computational prediction methods. As recent successful strategies for secondary structure prediction all rely on multiple sequence information, some methods for accurate protein multiple sequence alignments will also be described. While the main focus is on prediction methods for globular proteins, also the prediction of trans-membrane segments within membrane proteins will be briefly summarised. Finally, an integrated iterative approach tying secondary structure prediction and multiple alignment will be introduced [5].",

The first two schemes allow the compilation of residue-specific multiple alignment reliability indices, which can be used in an iterative fashion. The schemes have been implemented with associated iterative modes in the PRALINE multiple sequence alignment method, and have been evaluated using the BAliBASE benchmark alignment database. These tests indicate that PRALINE is a toolbox able to build alignments with very high quality. We found that local profile pre-processing raises the alignment quality by 5.5% compared to PRALINE alignments generated under default conditions. Iteration enhances the quality by a further percentage point. The implications of multiple alignment scoring functions and iteration in relation to alignment quality and benchmarking are discussed. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",
