      "sc:description": "Quantifying the importance of an inference model in Bayesian phylogenetics.\n\nSummary <jats:list list-type=\"order\"><jats:list-item> Phylogenetic trees are current routinely reconstructed from an alignment of character sequences (usually nucleotide sequences). Bayesian tools, such as MrBayes, RevBayes and BEAST2, have gained much popularity over the last decade, as they allow joint estimation of the posterior distribution of the phylogenetic tree and the parameters of the underlying inference model. An important ingredient of these Bayesian approaches is the species tree prior. While in principle the Bayesian framework allows for comparing different species tree priors and hence may elucidate the macroevolutionary processes underlying the species tree, in practice only macroevolutionary models that allow for fast computation of the prior probability are used.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'libre', 'jats:list-item', 'macroevolutionary'",
