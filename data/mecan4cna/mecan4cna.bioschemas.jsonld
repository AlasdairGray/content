Itâ€™s crucial to normalize CN profiles when comparing them in analysis, because usually each profile has a different signal scale | Mecan4CNA (Minimum Error Calibration and Normalization for Copy Number Analysis) uses an algebraic method to estimate the baseline and the distance between DNA levels (referred to as level distance). It can be used for both single file analysis and multi-file normalization | A copy number profile usually needs to be calibrated for the position of baseline (normal copy numbers) due to sample impurity and measurement bias.
