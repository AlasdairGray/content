The software consists of a collection of algorithms that are commonly used to solve (medical) image registration problems. The modular design of elastix allows the user to quickly configure, test, and compare different registration methods for a specific application. A command-line interface enables automated processing of large numbers of data sets, by means of scripting. Nowadays elastix is accompanied by SimpleElastix , making it available in languages like C++, Python, Java, R, Ruby, C# and Lua.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'dosimetric'",
