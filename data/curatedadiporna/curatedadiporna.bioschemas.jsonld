This package is a curated dataset of RNA-Seq samples. The samples are MDI-induced pre-phagocytes (3T3-L1) at different time points/stage of differentiation. The package document the data collection, pre-processing and processing. In addition to the documentation, the package contains the scripts that was used to generated the data in inst/scripts/ and the final RangedSummarizedExperiment object in data/.\n\nDOI: 10.18129/B9.bioc.curatedAdipoRNA.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'curatedAdipoChIP', 'curatedAdipoRNA curatedAdipoChIP'",
