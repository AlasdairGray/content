  "sc:description": "An Integrated Pipeline for Annotation and Visualization of Metagenomic Contigs.\n\nMetaErg is a stand-alone and fully automated metagenomic and metaproteomic data annotation pipeline. It bundles essential annotation tasks such as feature prediction, functional annotation with Hidden Markov Model (HMM) searches as well as blast and diamond searches. It estimates and visualizes quantitative taxonomic and pathway compositions of multiple metagenomic and proteomics samples using sequencing coverage and proteomics spectral counts, respectively. For visualization, MetaErg provides a HTML interface, bringing all annotation results together in sortable and searchable tables, collapsible trees, and other graphic representations, enabling intuitive navigation of complex data.\n\nAnalysis statistics: master.stats.txt.\n\nAnalysis annotation in gff format: master.gff.txt.\n\nMetaErg begins biological feature and element prediction by identifying CRISPR elements and non-coding RNA genes (tRNA, rRNA genes)",
