  "sc:description": "Predicting diabetes second-line therapy initiation in the Australian population via time span-guided neural attention network.\n\nTANGLE: Time spAN Guided neuraL attEntion model.\n\nTANGLE is a timespan-guided neural attention mechanism that can be used to integrate sequences of Medicare services and the time span between them to provide interpretable patients representations, which can be further used for some target prediction task.\n\nPredictive capabilities of TANGLE are demonstrated here with an application on the 10% publicly available sample of deidentified, individual level, linked Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) electronic databases of Australia. Starting from sequences of MBS-items and timespans, TANGLE can predict which diabetic patient, currently on metformin only, is likely to be prescribed with a different type of diabetes controlling drug in the near future.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'IMPLEMENTATION:Tangle', 'Tangle'",
