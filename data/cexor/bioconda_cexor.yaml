description: Strand specific peak-pair calling in ChIP-exo replicates. The cumulative
  Skellam distribution function (package 'skellam') is used to detect significant
  normalised count differences of opposed sign at each DNA strand (peak-pairs). Irreproducible
  discovery rate for overlapping peak-pairs across biological replicates is estimated
  using the package 'idr'.
