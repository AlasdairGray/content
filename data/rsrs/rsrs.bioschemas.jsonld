  "sc:description": "Rice Stress-Resistant SNP Database.\n\nRice Stress Resistant SNP Database.\n\nRice (Oryza sativa L.) yield is limited inherently by environmental stresses, including biotic and abiotic stresses. Thus, it is of great importance to perform in-depth explorations on the genes that are closely associated with the stress-resistant traits in rice. The Rice Stress-Resistant SNP Database incorporates the phenotype information of 400 rice varieties and the function and genome annotation of about 9.5 million stress-resistant SNPs detected from these stress-resistant rice varieties.\n\n400 Biotic and abiotic stress resistant varieties.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Rice Stress-Resistant', 'RESULTS:Rice Stress-Resistant', 'CONCLUSION:RSRS', 'Rice Stress-Resistant SNP'",
