  "sc:description": "PHENO aims to provide access to plant phenotypic datasets, with a major focus on the woody plant domain.\n\nPlant phenotyping is central to plant research and breeding and is becoming increasingly throughput, with large amounts of data being generated from diverse experimental settings. Access to phenotypic datasets annotated according to widely accepted standards contributes for data interoperability, enabling powerful genotype-phenotype association studies.",
