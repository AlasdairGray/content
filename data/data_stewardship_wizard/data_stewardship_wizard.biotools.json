                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019 The Author(s).The Data Stewardship Wizard is a tool for data management planning that is focused on getting the most value out of data management planning for the project itself rather than on fulfilling obligations. It is based on FAIR Data Stewardship, in which each data-related decision in a project acts to optimize the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and/or Reusability of the data. The background to this philosophy is that the first reuser of the data is the researcher themselves. The tool encourages the consulting of expertise and experts, can help researchers avoid risks they did not know they would encounter by confronting them with practical experience from others, and can help them discover helpful technologies they did not know existed. In this paper, we discuss the context and motivation for the tool, we explain its architecture and we present key functions, such as the knowledge model evolvability and migrations, assembling data management plans, metrics and evaluation of data management plans.",

Based on a literature review 14 DMP tools were selected and were evaluated using 45 selected parameters. The study enlists and enunciates the features of DMP tools, spots several gaps in DMP practices, and provides a few recommendations that can improve the existing tools and DMP practices. Compared to other related works, present work sheds extra light on percentage coverage of parameters by each tool and percentage coverage of tools by each parameter. It is identified that selected tools cover 50%\u201384% parameters, whereas 78% parameters are covered by half the selected DMP tools. Moreover, 28% of the tools cover 60% of the DMP assisting parameters. Additionally, co-occurrence of parameters and correlation among the tools are illustrated using matrices. It was found that co-occurrence of data description/summary/collection, documentation and metadata, findability, and accessibility parameters are relatively higher and all the selected tools are positively correlated to each other. The study is impactful for the researchers, librarians, data managers, and funding agencies for selecting an appropriate DMP tool as per their requirement.",
