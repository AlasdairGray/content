      "sc:description": "Data Adaptive Robust Estimation in Linear Regression with Application in GTEx Gene Expressions.\n\nAbstract With the development of high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology, the Genotype Tissue-Expression (GTEx) project (Consortium et al., 2015) generated a valuable resource of gene expression data from more than 11,000 samples. The large-scale data set is a powerful resource for understanding the human transcriptome. However, the technical variation, sequencing background noise and unknown factors make the statistical analysis challenging. To eliminate the possibility that outliers might affect the estimation of population distribution, we need a more robust estimation method, a method that will adapt to heterogeneous genes and further optimize the estimate for each gene.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'data-adaptive', '+', 'GTEx' (bio.tools/gtex), '-density-power-weight'",
