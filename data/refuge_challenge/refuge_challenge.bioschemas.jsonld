  "sc:description": "A unified framework for evaluating automated methods for glaucoma assessment from fundus photographs.\n\nThe goal of the Retinal Fundus Glaucoma Challenge (REFUGE) is to evaluate and compare automated algorithms for glaucoma detection and optic disc/cup segmentation on a common dataset of retinal fundus images.\n\nThe REFUGE challenge is open for participation!.\n\nREFUGE challenge is partnering with OMIA to widen the opportunities to present your work at MICCAI. In addition to the traditional oral and poster presentations of OMIA, REFUGE offers the chance to try your software on a real challenge, this year with fundus images.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'REFUGE'",
