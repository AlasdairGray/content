      "sc:description": "A Tagmentation-Mediated 3' Sequencing Approach for Improving Scalability of RNAseq Experiments.\n\nRNA-seq has become the standard tool for collecting genome-wide expression data in diverse fields, from quantitative genetics and medical genomics to ecology and developmental biology. However, RNA-seq library preparation is still prohibitive for many laboratories. Recently, the field of single-cell transcriptomics has reduced costs and increased throughput by adopting early barcoding and pooling of individual samples-producing a single final library containing all samples. In contrast, RNA-seq protocols where each sample is processed individually are significantly more expensive and lower throughput than single-cell approaches. Yet, many projects depend on individual library generation to preserve important samples or for follow-up re-sequencing experiments.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
