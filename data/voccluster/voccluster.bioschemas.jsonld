      "sc:description": "Untargeted Metabolomics Feature Clustering Approach for Clinical Breath Gas Chromatography.\n\nMetabolic profiling of breath analysis involves processing, alignment, scaling and clustering of thousands of features ex-tracted from Gas Chromatography Mass spectrometry (GC-MS) data from hundreds of participants. The multi-step data processing is complicated, operator error-prone and time-consuming. Automated algorithmic clustering methods that are able to cluster features in a fast and reliable way are necessary. These accelerate metabolic profiling and discovery plat-forms for next generation medical diagnostic tools. Our unsupervised clustering technique, VOCCluster, prototyped in Py-thon, handles features of deconvolved GC-MS breath data. VOCCluster was created from a heuristic ontology based on the observation of experts undertaking data processing with a suite of software packages.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
