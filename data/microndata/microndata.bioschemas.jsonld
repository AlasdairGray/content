  "sc:description": "A simple, web-based repository for the management, access and analysis of micrographic images.\n\nMicroscopy is advancing at a rapid pace, enabling high-speed, high-resolution analyses to be conducted in a wide range of cellular contexts. For example, the capacity to quickly capture high-resolution images from multiple optical sections over multiple channels with confocal microscopy has allowed researchers to gain deeper understanding of tissue morphology via techniques such as three-dimensional rendering, as have more recent advances such as lattice light sheet microscopy and superresolution structured illumination microscopy. With this, though, comes the challenge of storing, curating, analysing and sharing data. While there are ways in which this has been attempted previously, few approaches have provided a central repository in which all of these different aspects of microscopy can be seamlessly integrated",
