      "sc:description": "Exploring the implementation of the Community for Successful Ageing (ComSA)program in Singapore.\n\nBACKGROUND:The Community for Successful Ageing (ComSA) program has implemented overlapping BioPsychoSocial (BPS) components as part of a Community Development (CD) grassroots and volunteer-led initiative. Implementation of such multi-component programming is influenced by known program characteristics including novelty, complexity and observability as well as related organizational factors. As such, we explored ComSA CD's implementation from the organizational perspective, seeking to inform program improvements. METHODS:We conducted four focus groups with program staff, partners and trainers (total N = 21 participants).\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Exploring implementation Community Successful Ageing Singapore', 'ComSA', 'BioPsychoSocial', 'organizational'",
