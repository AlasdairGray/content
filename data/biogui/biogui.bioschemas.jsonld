Such a GUI then enables many more people to use their software. Especially in biology, the domain experts are often computer novices and have difficulties using tools written for them by bioinformaticiens/computer scientists.\n\nbioGUI documentation â€” bioGUI documentation.\n\nAn python argparse-extension which first supplies two useful argparse-type extensions and second provides means to convert the python argparse parser into a bioGUI template.\n\nFree document hosting provided by Read the Docs",
