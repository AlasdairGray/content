    "description": "Norovirus, also called the \"winter vomiting bug\", is the most common cause of gastroenteritis. It is also a common cause of food poisoning and is usually related to consumption of undercooked shellfish. Infection can be spread person-to-person or through a common source such as contaminated food or water. Virus is shed in stool for an average of 4 weeks after infection, and prolonged shedding in immunocompromised patients may occur.",
