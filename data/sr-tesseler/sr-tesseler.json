    "description": "This tool is an open-source segmentation software using Voronoi tessellation constructed from the coordinates of localized molecules. It allows precise, robust and automatic quantification of protein organization at different scales, from the cellular level down to clusters of a few fluorescent markers. It is insensitive to cell shape, molecular organization, background and noise, allowing comparing efficiently different biological conditions in a non-biased manner.",

This task often involves complex image processing adapted to the specific topology and quality of the image to be analyzed. Here we present a segmentation framework based on Voronoï tessellation constructed from the coordinates of localized molecules, implemented in freely available and open-source SR-Tesseler software. This method allows precise, robust and automatic quantification of protein organization at different scales, from the cellular level down to clusters of a few fluorescent markers. We validated our method on simulated data and on various biological experimental data of proteins labeled with genetically encoded fluorescent proteins or organic fluorophores. In addition to providing insight into complex protein organization, this polygon-based method should serve as a reference for the development of new types of quantifications, as well as for the optimization of existing ones.",
