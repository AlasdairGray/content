  "sc:description": "Evaluation of Cell Type Deconvolution R Packages on Single Cell RNA-seq Data.\n\nAbstract Annotating cell types is a critical step in single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data analysis. Some deconvolution methods have recently emerged to enable automated cell type identification. However, comprehensive evaluations of these methods are lacking to provide practical guidelines. Moreover, it is not clear whether some deconvolution methods originally designed for analyzing other omics data are adaptable to scRNA-Seq analysis. In this study, we evaluated ten cell-type deconvolution methods publicly available as R packages. Eight of them are popular methods developed specifically for single cell research (Seurat, scmap, SingleR, CHETAH, SingleCellNet, scID, Garnett, SCINA).\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'SingleR', 'Seurat', 'deconvolution', 'SingleR CP'",
