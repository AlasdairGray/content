This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted reuse, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.In the Tohoku Medical Megabank project, genome and omics analyses of participants in two cohort studies were performed. A part of the data is available at the Japanese Multi Omics Reference Panel (jMorp; https://jmorp.megabank.tohoku.ac.jp) as a web-based database, as reported in our previous manuscript published in Nucleic Acid Research in 2018. At that time, jMorp mainly consisted of metabolome data; however, now genome, methylome, and transcriptome data have been integrated in addition to the enhancement of the number of samples for the metabolome data. For genomic data, jMorp provides a Japanese reference sequence obtained using de novo assembly of sequences from three Japanese individuals and allele frequencies obtained using whole-genome sequencing of 8,380 Japanese individuals. In addition, the omics data include methylome and transcriptome data from \u223c300 samples and distribution of concentrations of more than 755 metabolites obtained using high-throughput nuclear magnetic resonance and high-sensitivity mass spectrometry. In summary, jMorp now provides four different kinds of omics data (genome, methylome, transcriptome, and metabolome), with a user-friendly web interface. This will be a useful scientific data resource on the general population for the discovery of disease biomarkers and personalized disease prevention and early diagnosis.",
