      "sc:description": "A software tool for peptide specificity analysis.\n\nThe discovery and characterization of molecular interactions is crucial towards a better understanding of complex biological processes. Particularly protein-protein interactions (i.e., PPIs), which are responsible for a variety of cellular functions from intracellular signaling to enzyme-substrate specificity, have been studied broadly over the past decades. Position-specific scoring matrices (PSSM) in particular are used extensively to help determine interaction specificity or candidate interaction motifs at the residue level. However, not all studies successfully report their results as a candidate interaction motif. In many cases, this may be due to a lack of suitable tools for simple analysis and motif generation.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| NAME EQUAL TO (PUB. DIFFERENT) bio.tools/PeSA",
