  "sc:description": "Simultaneous detection and quantification of DNA and protein biomarkers in spectrum of cardiovascular diseases in a microfluidic microbead chip.\n\nAnalysis, visualisation and data mining of POCT experiments.\n\ndigilogger is available as the latest development version of the code by using the devtools R package.\n\nOur digilogger standalone graphical user interface allows the analysis of dPCR data without installing the package on a server. Since the digilogger software is based on modern web technologies like HTML5 it will run on any modern web browser. Additionally, the software works when run in RStudio or RKWard (version 0.7.0z+0.7.1+devel1). The digilogger software works platform independent (tested on Linux and Windows).\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'cfmDNA', 'microbeads', 'microfluidic', 'biomarkers'",
