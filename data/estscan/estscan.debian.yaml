description: ESTScan is a program that can detect coding regions in DNA sequences,
  even if they are of low quality. ESTScan will also detect and correct sequencing
  errors that lead to frameshifts. ESTScan is not a gene prediction program , nor
  is it an open reading frame detector. In fact, its strength lies in the fact that
  it does not require an open reading frame to detect a coding region. As a result,
  the program may miss a few translated amino acids at either the N or the C terminus,
  but will detect coding regions with high selectivity and sensitivity. . ESTScan
  takes advantages of the bias in hexanucleotide usage found in coding regions relative
  to non-coding regions. This bias is formalized as an inhomogeneous 3-periodic fifth-order
  Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Additionally, the HMM of ESTScan has been extended to
  allows insertions and deletions when these improve the coding region statistics.
