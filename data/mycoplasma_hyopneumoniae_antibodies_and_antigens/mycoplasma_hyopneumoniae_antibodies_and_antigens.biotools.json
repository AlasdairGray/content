    "description": "Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae is one of the smallest bacteria in nature which lacks a cell wall, has a very small amount of genetic material. This organism is ubiquitous within swine herds throughout the world. By itself, M hyopneumoniae is minimally pathogenic; however, when it infects pigs concurrently with other bacteria and viruses, it remains one of the most problematic organisms to the swine industry. It is recognized as the causative agent of enzootic pneumonia and is a primary contributor to the porcine respiratory disease complex.",
